0,247,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left leg pain.  The onset 
was a few years ago, and increased with a fall about 1 year ago.  He has lower back 
pain daily and finds it difficulty to work. He has standing and walking tolerances of 
only about 5 minutes.  He has not notice any significant improvement with exercises.  
Paraspinal injections did not provide him with any relief.  His medical history is 
unremarkable, but he says that he is pre-diabetic.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L4/5 radiculopathy.  
There is weakness of the left quadriceps and left extensor hallucis longus.  There is 
reduced left patellar reflex.  There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  The 
lumbar MRI was performed January 22, 2021 which reveals a Grade 1 anterolisthesis 
with lysis at L4-5.  There is severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally at this level.  There 
is severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and lower lumbar facet arthrosis, worse at L3-4.
In view of the worsening pain despite the passage of time and conservative 
management, his deteriorated quality of life, as well as my examination and MRI 
findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed exercises.

1,252,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right more than left posterior thigh pain.  
She is reporting right groin pain.  She has limited walking and standing tolerance.  
She has a history of chronic lower back pain exacerbated with lifting a few months 
ago.  She attends physical therapy weekly which helps a little.  She does yoga and 
bicycles about 10 minutes per day.  Her medical history includes rheumatoid arthritis 
affecting mostly her hands and right knee.  She had a thyroidectomy and takes 
Eltroxin.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  Her 
clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar MRI 
from February 3, 2022 reveals moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 with 
possible impingement of the left L4 nerve root at L3-4.  There is reduced ranges of 
the right hip and recreation on groin pain on provocative testing.
Xrays of her right hip were performed today and these reveal moderate to severe 
osteoarthritis.  I recommend that she be referred into the rapid access hip and knee 
program for further evaluation.  I have also referred her for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha regarding the claudicant symptoms.  She should 
continue with self-directed exercises and can continue with the physical therapy if it 
is helping.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

"
2,254,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right foot pain and sometimes into the leg.  
He had a flare up about 1 month ago with lifting, but his symptoms have been 
present for several years.  His sleep is not disturbed due to pain.  He has had 
physical therapy and chiropractic care without significant relief.  He has not had any 
injections.  His general medical history is unremarkable, other than having had 
necrotizing fasciitis as a child requiring multiple surgeries.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is no significant motor deficit, except for weakness of the right EHL.  There is 
no nerve root tension.  An EMG in 2019 revealed findings of L5 radiculopathy.  The 
most recent MRI of his lumbar spine was performed March 29, 2022 which reveals a 
small right L5-S1 paracentral disc herniation.  On personal review of images there is 
marked right foraminal stenosis at the same level with likely impingement of the L5 
nerve root from a combination of degenerative changes, including disc 
protrusion/bulge.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain and foraminal stenosis on MRI, as well as the 
ongoing limitations in functioning, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consideration with Dr. Smith.  We discussed alternatives including intradiscal CT 
guided ozone and I am not certain that he is the best surgical candidate, but given 
the disc protrusion contributing to the stenosis, it is definitely worthwhile having a 
discussion.  He should continue with self-directed exercises.

"
3,255,"With regard to her lower back pain, I have recommended to Ms. Smith that she 
follow-up with her pain clinic.  Consideration could be given to facet joint/medial 
branch block injections.  I am referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith regarding the thoracic disc protrusion and cord compression, notwithstanding 
that there are no clear signs of myelopathy on physical examination.  Ms. Smith is 
encouraged to continue with activities to tolerance.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and also right more than leg 
pain paresthesia.  He estimates that 80% of his difficulties pertain to his lower back.  
He has had physical therapy and osteopathy with temporary relief of pain.  He has 
also had hip injections which has provided temporary relief.  He is working 2 1/2 
days per weeks.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with mechanical back pain and neurogenic 
claudication.  There is no significant neurological deficit, other than mild weakness of 
the left EHL.  A lumbar MRI was performed November 3, 2021 reveals severe spinal 
canal stenosis at L4-5 and moderate foraminal stenosis.  There is severe lateral 
recess stenosis at L3-4, worse on the left.
Given the back dominance of his pain, I have referred him for consideration of 
medial branch blocks/facet joint blocks.  I have encouraged him to continue with 
self-directed exercises to maintain his mobility.  I am also referring him for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha with regard to the severe canal stenosis and 
claudicant symptoms.

"
5,261,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was insidious in 
September 2021.  She is also experiencing achiness at the anterior legs.  She is also 
describing a burning sensation in her feet, and she has bilateral knee pain.  She is 
able to void her bladder and there is no perineal numbness.  She reports to me that 
she is scheduled to have bilateral knee replacements.  Her health in general is good 
other than hypertension.  She used to clean houses and has been unable to return to 
work since October 2021.
The physical examination reveals her to be neurologically intact, other than reduced 
vibration sense in her feet.  She has significant genu Smith bilaterally.  She is 
status post compression fracture of T12 where there is 80% compression and bony 
retropulsion.  
At this time, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In preparation of the surgical consultation, I have requisitioned 
flexion-extension xray of the lumbar spine.  There is no evidence of instability. I have 
encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with activities to tolerance.  Much of her standing 
and walking limitation appears related to her knee troubles and I anticipate her 
functioning will improve post-knee replacement surgery.

"
6,263,"Ms. Howgego presents with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  The onset was 
about 5 years starting with cramping.  The symptoms are increased with walking 
and standing and relieved with sitting and lying down.  She describes paresthesia in 
her feet with lying down.  She has been prescribed exercises, but has not had any 
physical therapy.  For the past few months she has also been experiencing right 
groin pain.  Her medical history is unremarkable, other than a history of IBS.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficiency.  
There is no motor weakness.  There are reduced ranges of the right hip compared 
to the left, which precipitated groin pain.  A lumbar MRI was performed August 22, 
2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5.
Xrays of the right hip and pelvis were requisitioned today.  The radiology report 
notes mild to moderate degenerative changes.  On personal review the degenerative 
changes appear worse on the right.  There also appears to be a degree of 
protrusion acetabuli on the right.  Xray of the lumbar spine in standing was 
performed today for surgical planning.  The study reveals a right convex scoliosis
It is my impression that she is experiencing neurogenic claudication as well as right 
hip arthralgia.  In light of the ongoing leg pain and limited standing and walking 
tolerance (less than 5 minutes), as well as imaging findings, I am referring Ms. 
Howgego for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  At the same time, some 
of her functional problems are in part related to her hip.  I recommend that she be 
referred into the rapid access hip and knee program for further evaluation.  She 
should continue with home-based, self-directed exercises.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

"
7,269,"Ms. Smith says that her symptoms remain essentially the same.  There is still pain in 
the lower back and posterior thighs, but not radiating past the knees.  The lumbar 
MRI was performed May 17, 2022 and reveals a transitional lumbo-sacral segment.  
There is significant lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and marked facet arthropathy.  
There is a synovial cyst on the right compromising the lateral recess.  There is 
moderate to severe foraminal stenosis, worse on the left at L4-5.
In view of the continuing symptoms, functional limitations and MRI results, as well as 
limited response to conservative care, I am referring Ms. Tiers for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  With or without surgery, if back pain persists 
consideration could be given to referring Ms. Tiers for facet joint/medial branch 
blocks at the L4-5 level.  She can continue with the conservative therapies she has 
been undertaking if she finds benefit.  She should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises.

"
8,271,"The follow-up assessment today was conducted over the telephone.  Ms. Smith 
provided verbal consent to proceed with this consultation.
I initially saw Ms. Smith on April 14, 2022.  She was reporting chronic back pain 
and left leg pain to the foot.  She has had chiropractic care in the remote past which 
was helpful for back pain.  She described the left leg pain as located in the posterior 
thigh and sometimes tingling sensation in her heel.  The physical examination did not 
reveal any significant neurological deficit, but there was nerve root tension on the 
left.   She was scheduled for a lumbar MRI on April 22nd and I recommended to her 
that I follow-up with her afterwards.  I recommended that she continue with 
self-directed exercises and that she could trial manual therapy on her lower back.
Ms. Smith says that she continues to have lower back and left lower extremity pain.  
She has started a new course of physical therapy without relief.  She is taking 8 
Percocet tablets per day for pain relief.  She is able to walk for distance.  Sleep is 
disturbed due to pain.
The MRI was performed April 22, 2022 and reveals an asymmetric left L5-S1 disc 
protrusion.  There is severe right foraminal stenosis at L4-5 and on the left at L5-S1.
In view of the ongoing leg pain, lack of response to exercises and the passage of 
time, and the examination and MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue 
with self-directed exercises.

"
9,276,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and bilateral leg pain.  The 
back pain has been present for about 18 months and she characterizes the pain as a 
pressure or stabbing sensation; increased with prolonged sitting, standing and with 
bending.  Lying down provides relief.  Physical therapy, acupuncture and osteopathy 
have not provided her with any significant relief.  She has also had intramuscular 
injections without relief.  She has tried decompression (traction) without relief.  Her 
medical history is unremarkable, other than a history of kidney stones for which she 
has had lithotripsy.
Ms. Smith was employed as an Educational Assistant, but has not been able to 
return to work since November 2021.  She has been using a cane for a couple of 
months to help with her walking tolerance.
The physical examination today suggests that her back pain is mechanical and 
discogenic.  Her leg pain may be related to nerve root irritation.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed August 18, 2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of midline disc protrusion 
at L5-S1 and mild foraminal stenosis.  Ms. Smith says that her symptoms have 
worsened since this MRI and that a requisition for an updated MRI has been placed.
Given the back dominance of her pain, I am not convinced that she is the best 
surgical candidate. However, given the presence of leg pain and MRI findings, I have 
referred her for spine surgical consultation, as she also wished to pursue any 
surgical option.  I have referred her to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon.  I have also 
referred her to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet 
joint blocks.  Notwithstanding the disc protrusion at L5-S1 she could trial up to 10 
sessions of chiropractic spinal mobilization/manipulation.  I have encouraged her to 
continue with self-directed exercises.

"
10,280,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain and right more than left 
leg pain.  He has a longstanding history of lower back pain which he feels has been 
worsening over the last couple of years.  Pain disturbs his sleep.  He is able to void 
and here is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  He has had physical 
therapy and intramuscular injections without relief.  He tries to perform exercises at 
home.  Mr. Smith's medical history includes MI 4 years ago and 3 cardiac stents.  
He suffered a stroke which has left him partially blind.  He smokes about 2 packs of 
cigarettes per day.  He has a stomach ulcer.
Mr. Smith has tried physical therapy and intramuscular injections in the past 
without relief.  He has not had treatment in the past few years. He does not wish to 
pursue further conservative care as he does not think it will help.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is no identified nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 8, 
2021.   The cardinal finding is a small focal right paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1 
and mild right foraminal stenosis.  There appears to be right L5 nerve compression.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith has right L5/S1 radicular symptoms.  His 
back pain is mechanical.  He was insistent that surgical intervention is the best route 
for him at this point.  While I do agree that surgery may help with his right leg pain, 
his health history would indicate that he may not be the best surgical candidate.  
Surgery may not help with his lower back pain.  I am referring him to Dr. D. Guha for 
his opinion.  For his back pain he could trial side posture spinal manipulation, and if 
this doesn't help, then facet joint/medial branch blocks.  He was reluctant/did not 
wish to pursue further conservative care, in part because he doesn't think it will help, 
and in part that he cannot afford chiro or physio.  I have encouraged him to continue 
with self-directed exercises.

11,281,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of midline lower back pain.  The 
onset was several years ago but pain is worsening.  There is an increase in pain 
with walking and standing, and relief with lying down.  She sought out chiropractic 
care in 2016 without relief.  She does not find that exercises are helping much.  She 
has some bowel urgency, but there is no urinary retention and no perineal numbness 
of saddle anesthesia.  She has limited walking and standing tolerance of about 5 
minutes due to the back pain.  Ms. Smith has occasional numbness in her great 
toes.  Pain can disrupt her sleep and the only medication she is taking is Tylenol 3 
qhs.
Ms. Smith's health history includes having had a right total hip replacement in 
2017, and she is scheduled for a left Smith.  A recent right hip diagnostic ultrasound 
reveals partial thickness tear of the gluteus minimus.  She has just started a new job 
which is sedentary in nature.  She used to work as a driver and teach art, neither of 
which she can do.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
She has mechanical back pain related to a Grade I/II spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.  
There is severe degenerative disc changes and right foraminal stenosis, and 
moderate on the left.  The paresthesia she is experiencing in her great toes is 
related to L5 nerve root irritation.
Given the worsening and disabling lower back pain, MRI findings and notwithstanding 
that she is also scheduled to have her left hip replaced, I am referring Ms. 
Beardwood for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged 
her to remain active to tolerance and continue with self-directed exercises.  Further 
comment is deferred to Dr. Smith.

12,286,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left leg pain.  The onset was in the 
summer of 2021, but he did have some prior lower back pain/buttock pain.  He 
describes numbness distal to the knee and weakness and foot drop on the left which 
is worsening.  Physical therapy did not provide him with any significant relief.  Mr. 
Kirouac is also describing weakness of his arms.  His medical history includes Smith's 
disease.  He is very limited in his ability to perform chores at home.
Mr. Smith presented in a wheelchair.  There is cyanosis of his feet.  He walks with 
a steppage gait with his left lower limb.  There is marked reduction in power of 
resisted left foot dorsiflexion at 1+/5.  There is also weakness of right foot 
dorsiflexion and EHL.  There is nerve root tension on the left.  A lumbar MRI 
performed March 29, 2022 reveals cardinal findings of severe foraminal stenosis on 
the left at L4-5 and L5-S1.  There is also lateral recess stenosis on the left at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing a left L5 radiculopathy.  Dr. 
Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon, was in the clinic today and kindly agreed to 
see Mr. Smith.  Apparently, further neurogical work up is deemed required, and 
further comment is deferred to Dr. Smith's report.  I have recommended that Mr. 
Smith see his physician for referral for an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) to help 
minimize the chance of a fall.

Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and leg pain.  There is left leg 
numbness and tingling, and right posterior thigh burning and ache.  Symptoms have 
been worse in the past month.  She says that she has had lower back pain since 
childhood.  The has had injections in her lower back as well as rhizotomy without

have dyslipidemia.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  The back 
pain is mechanical.
A lumbar MRI was performed January 17, 2021 and reveals a degenerative 
spondylolisthesis at L4-5 with moderate to severe canal stenosis.  There is bilateral

Pain produced with both flexion and extension
N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and right leg pain.  The 
onset was in August 2021 without precipitating event recalled.  There is an increase 
in pain with walking and standing, and relief with lying down.  He had physical 
therapy without relief.
The physical examination findings are suggestive of right L3-4 radiculopathy.  There 
are no long tract signs.  A lumbar MRI reveals a disc protrusion at T11-12 with 
displacement of spinal cord and moderate to severe canal stenosis.  There is a small 
foci of hyper intense signal change on T2 weighted images at T12.  There is 
moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L3-4 on the right.
At this time, notwithstanding the absence of signs of myelopathy, but given the 
changes on MRI at T11-12, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  His leg symptoms may be related to the foraminal 
stenosis at L3-4 on the right.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed 
exercises.

"
16,296,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and buttock pain.  There is 
numbness at the posterior thighs and legs.  The right thigh pain is worse than the 
left.  He has perineal numbness and reports that he has to exert himself when 
voiding his bladder.  He does indicate he can void.  He says that his feet are 
completely numb.  He did attend for physical therapy for about a month and found 
the treatment/exercises helpful.  Unfortunately, he was cut off from social services 
and cost considerations have prevented him from returning.  The onset of symptoms 
began as back pain, as a result of a motor vehicle accident about 7 years ago and 
his condition has worsened.  His health in general is good.
The physical examination and clinical presentation is consistent with neurogenic 
claudication.  I am concerned about an evolving incomplete cauda equine syndrome 
due to the report of perineal numbness and having to having to exert himself to void 
his bladder.  A lumbar MRI was performed November 15, 2021 and reveals severe 
canal and foraminal stenosis at L4-5 and moderate at L5-S1.
I am referring Mr.  Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I would 
like Mr. Smith to be seen sooner rather than later, and have arranged for him to be 
seen next week.  In the interim, he should be continuing with activities to tolerance.  
Should he experience any bladder retention or if his perineal numbness increases, 
then he has been instructed to attend at the ER at HGH.

"
17,297,"Mr. Smith reports a chief complaint of left sided burning in the perineum and 
teste.  He sometimes experiences sharp pain in the left buttock.  The onset was 
insidious in October 2021, but he has a prior history of lower back pain.  He says that 
when he urinates he cannot tell if he's finished due to numbness.  He has a prior 
history of left leg pain, but nothing presently. There is an increase in pain with 
sitting, but walking is unremarkable.  He is able to get restful sleep and complete all 
of his activities of daily living.  He attended physical therapy without relief, and 
traction made his pain worse.
His medical history is remarkable for diabetes diagnosed in 2003, dyslipidemia, 
essential hypertension, and a myocardial infarction requiring stenting in 2017.
The history suggests possible incomplete cauda equine syndrome.  There is no 
significant neurological deficit and no lower extremity nerve root tension.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed March 26, 2022 reveals a left L5-S1 disc protrusion with 
displacement of left S1 nerve root.  There is a very large Tarlov cyst in the sacrum.  
Mr. Smith reports having had a pelvic ultrasound which was reportedly 
unremarkable.
At this time, notwithstanding improvement to date, but given the history of left 
buttock and leg pain episodes, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation.  I would not expect the disc protrusion to cause compression of the 
nerve roots that can lead to cauda equine syndrome, but query whether the very 
large Smith cyst may be compromising the sacral nerve roots.  I am referring Mr. 
Smith to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon, for his opinion.  I also recommend that Mr. 
Smith be referred to a Urologist to rule out a urological disorder.  Mr. Smith 
should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

18,298,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left lateral leg and pain to the dorsum of the 
foot and medial three toes.  The onset was in April 2020 with coming off a ladder, 
and he reports that he has not experienced any significant improvement, despite 
having undergone chiropractic care and physical therapy.  He has attended at ER on 
a few occasions with intense flare-up.  He is performing self-directed exercises.  He 
cannot run, but plays gentle Tennis.  His general health history is essentially 
unremarkable.  He had a prior bicycle accident and suffered neck pain.  He continues 
to work as an Insurance Broker.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L4/5 radiculopathy.  
There is nerve root tension on the left.  There is no significant weakness, other than 
mild weakness to resisted testing of left foot dorsiflexion.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed September 22, 2021 and reveals cardinal findings of severe left foraminal 
stenosis at L4-5 and at L3-4 there is a left paracentral disc protrusion.
In view of the persisting left leg dominant pain despite conservative care, the 
examination findings and MRI results, and impact the pain is having on his quality of 
life, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I 
have concomitantly requisitioned EMG investigation to provide additional diagnostic 
information.

"
19,300,"Ms. Smith was initially seen on April 26, 2022 at which time she presented with a 
complaint of right medial knee and numbness in her legs.  She has limited walking 
and standing tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  The lower extremity symptoms 
began in 2019.  She has had hip difficulties.  She had her left hip replaced in 2017 
and then later developed cellulitis.  She was to have her right hip replaced, but this 
never occurred due to her cellulitis and the covid-19 pandemic.  She has had 
cortisone injections with limited relief.  She says that she uses a ""Dr. Smith"" belt which 
does provide some relief of leg symptoms.  Her medical history includes diabetes, 
hypertension and hypothyroidism.  Her clinical presentation was commensurate with 
neurogenic claudication.  She also has limited walking and standing tolerance due to 
the right hip.  A lumbar MRI performed in 2019 reveals severe spinal canal stenosis 
at L2-3 and L3-4.  There is an old 50% compression fracture of L2.  I requisitioned 
an updated lumbar MRI with a view that we will likely be referring her on for spine 
surgical consultation.  I did feel that some of her right knee pain may be referred 
from the hip and there is also tenderness at the medial joint line, so there is likely 
degenerative changes of the right knee itself.  The paresthesia in her legs is likely 
due to the neurogenic claudication.  I have recommended to her that she follow-up 
with her hip surgeon and follow their recommendations and xrays of the right knee 
should be considered. 
The lumbar MRI was performed June 29, 2022.  There is severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L2-3 and moderate to severe at L3-4.
On follow-up today Ms. Smith says that her symptoms remain the same.  She 
continues to have functional limitations.
My clinical impression remains the same in that she has symptoms consistent with 
neurogenic claudication.  Given the MRI findings and ongoing limitations in standing 
and walking, I have recommended a spine surgical consultation.  Ms. Smith has 
specifically requested Dr. Smith, and I am endeavoring to facilitate this.  She should 
continue with flexion-based exercises.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock and leg pain.  The onset was in 
August 2021 and Mr. Smith has experienced some improvement.  He has had 
chiropractic care and acupuncture which have helped.  He continues with 
self-directed exercises at home.  His medical history includes episodic lower back 
pain and a history of GERD.  His surgical history includes cholecystectomy and left 
biceps repair.  He works as a Clerk and is continuing to work.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  A

there was reduced flexion and internal rotation of the right hip.  Plain film 
radiographs today only reveal mild chondrocalcinosis.
In view of the right leg dominant pain, the examination and MRI findings, and

be more related to degenerative changes in his left hip.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There is nerve root tension on the left.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 8, 
2021 reveals lateral recess stenosis bilaterally at L4-5 and L5-S1.
Mr. Smith has left L5/S1 radicular symptoms.  Given the ongoing leg pain, the 
functional limitations, examination findings and MRI results, I am referring Mr. 
Rhodes for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged him to 
continue with self-directed exercises.  I recommend that he be referred into the 
central intake hip and knee program for further evaluation of his left hip.

23,30,"At this time, given the leg dominant pain, examination and MRI findings, and ongoing 
significant limitation in walking tolerance, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Given her age and comorbidities, I am not 
certain that she is a good surgical candidate, but given lack of reasonable 
alternatives, I feel it is appropriate that we seek this opinion.  I have recommended 
to Ms. Smith that she follow-up with her physician about medication options 
other than the Tylenol 3 she takes.  I query whether a neuromodulator such as 
Gapabentin or Pregabalin may be helpful.  I have encouraged her to perform activity

N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left leg pain.  She also has lower 
back pain.  The left leg pain has been present for a few years and is worsening.  
She characterizes the pain as a burning sensation.  She has not had physical 
therapy, but is swimming and lifting weights which helps.  Her medical/surgical 
history includes right total hip replacement, myocardial infarction and stents, and 
hypertension.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with unilateral neurogenic claudication.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed February 5, 2022 reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at 
L4-5 and mild foraminal stenosis.
In view of the leg dominant pain, functional limitations, worsening of symptoms and

Guha.  She should continue with her aquatherapy and other exercises.  There is no 
need for follow-up with myself.

25,311,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation on April 29, 2022.  He reported lower 
back and left more than right leg pain.  The left lower extremity pain travelled to the 
calf, but was most troublesome at the lateral thigh. Lower back pain was 
intermittent.  The onset of symptoms was about 5 years ago.  Mr. Smith was 
attending for massage therapy every three weeks which he found helpful.  He had 
tried physical therapy and chiropractic care in the past without relief.  His medical 
history includes diabetes and hypertension.  The clinical presentation and 
examination was suggestive of left L5 nerve root irritation.  There is no neurological 
deficit identified on physical examination. There are no long tract signs.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed December 10, 2018 reveals a Grade I spondylolisthesis at L5-S1, 
pars defect of L5 and significant left foraminal stenosis.  He was scheduled for an 
updated MRI on August 21, 2022 and I recommended that I follow-up with him after 
that.
The MRI was performed August 21, 2022 and reveals substantially similar findings to 
the study of 2018.  There is a Grade anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 and severe left 
foraminal stenosis.  There is some foraminal stenosis on the right.
Mr. Smith reports on follow-up today that his symptoms remain essentially the same.  
He continues to have left leg dominant pain and limited walking tolerance of about 
half a km.  It remains my opinion that he has left L5 nerve root involvement.  Given 
the unremitting nature of his leg dominant pain and imaging findings, I am referring 
him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  In the interim, 
he should continue with self-directed exercises.

Summarizing Paragraph:
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock and leg pain.  
Symptoms are chronic but increased as of October 2021.  Pain is not improving.  She 
has very limited walking tolerance.  She has consulted with a physiatrist who 
performed intraarticular injection in the right hip, but this provided only very 
transient relief.  Her general health is good.
The physical examination reveals findings suggestive of right L4 nerve root irritation.  
However, her clinical presentation and pain levels appeared disproportionate to what 
is seen on the lumbar MRI where there is right L3-4 disc herniation and foraminal 
protrusion.  There is marked reduction in right hip ranges of motion with pain.  Plain 
film radiographs of the right hip were performed today and these reveal moderate to 
severe right hip join degeneration.
My clinical impression is that most of Ms. Smith's functional limitations are related 
to the right hip pathology.  Pain more distal to the knee may be stemming from L4 
nerve root irritation, and given the MRI findings, I have referred her for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I recommend that Ms. Smith be referred 
into the MSK Central Intake program for hips and knees for further evaluation and 
hip surgical consultation.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

28,314,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left leg and lower back pain.  The pain is 
chronic and exacerbated with any sustained positions or activities.   He describes left 
leg weakness and characterizes the leg symptoms as numbness with sharp pain.  
The leg pain can travel into the left foot.  He still attends physical therapy 
intermittently and has had chiropractic care in the past.  Treatments have not 
provided any significant relief.  Mr. Smith's health history includes having had a 
left L5-S1 discectomy in 2001.  His health history is otherwise unremarkable.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant motor deficit.  There 
is reduced sensation to sharp testing along the left L5 and S1 dermatomes.  There is 
a positive straight leg raise on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed September 28, 2021.  There is a cardinal finding of 
left L5-S1 disc herniation with moderate right and severe left foraminal stenosis.  
There is left more than right facet joint degenerative changes.  There is a broad 
based disc herniation at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing left leg radicular 
symptoms, likely from the lateral recess and foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 on the left.  
Given the ongoing pain and functional limitations, and lack of response to 
conservative care, I am referring him for a spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. 
Guha.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed exercises and he could 
follow-up with the advanced practice professional in the community for exercise 
review.  If back pain persists consideration could be given to referring Mr. Smith 
for medial branch/facet joint blocks of the lower lumbar spine at a pain clinic.

N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock and posterior thigh pain.  The 
onset was a few years ago and pain is worsening.  Physical therapy, chiropractic 
care, and osteopathy have not provided her with any significant relief.  She has had 
6 epidural injections and only 1 provided some relief transiently.  She applies heat at 
home, but is unable to get restful sleep.  She takes Advil, or Tylenol or Aleve prn.  
Her health in general is otherwise good.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes 
per day.
The physical examination findings are suggestive of right L5 radicular symptoms.  
There is no significant motor deficit.  A lumbar MRI was performed March 4, 2022 
and reveals a caudally directed disc extrusion at L4-5 with mild mass affect on the 
right L5 nerve root.
Given the ongoing and worsening leg dominant pain, the examination and MRI 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  
She should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

that she is scheduled to have a lumbar MRI in June 2022.
Given the limited walking and standing tolerance (less than 5 minutes), a lumbar MRI 
is required.  She has one scheduled for June and a potential option is for one to be 
requisitioned at GNMI (Mississauga) where there tends to be shorter wait times.

complaint of buttock and leg pain, right more than left, and described the pain as a 
sharp sensation with reduced walking tolerance.  He also says that he has burning 
sensation in his feet at nighttime.  He relates his back troubles to a work related 
injury in 1987.  Mr. Smith has sought out physical therapy without relief.  He has also 
had a series of epidurals which helped at first for a short time, but eventually 
stopped working.  He says that he had blood work done a few weeks ago and that 
testing, including fasting glucose, was normal.  The clinical presentation was 
suggested of neurogenic claudication, but the history is somewhat atypical.  While 
there are increased symptoms with walking and standing, Mr. Smith also reported 
leg symptoms with lying down and at nighttime.  The physical examination did not 
reveal any significant neurological deficit, which would not be unusual with 
neurogenic claudication.  However, given his comorbidities, I was not convinced he is 
the best spine surgical candidate.  This is notwithstanding that there is moderate 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 from an MRI August 27, 2021.  I wanted to rule out 
possible vasculogenic component to his symptoms and requisitioned Doppler 
investigation of his lower extremities.
The Ankle-Brachial indices did not reveal any signs of PAD.  Given this and the 
ongoing leg dominant pain, as well as MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for

a moderate to large L4-5 disc protrusion and severe canal stenosis.  Another MRI 
was performed October 8, 2021 and reveals L4-5 disc protrusion and right more 
than left lateral recess stenosis.
It is my impression that Mr. Smith is experiencing right L5 nerve root irritation 
from the disc protrusion at L4-5.  At this time, given the ongoing and recurrent 
episodes of radicular pain and the impact on his quality of life, as well as MRI 
findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  
Consideration should be given to referring him for an epidural injection and referral 
for this is deferred to his physician.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises.

"
48,352,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of bilateral left pain, much more prominent on 
the left than right.  The leg pain began about 8 months ago with a slip and fall, and 
pain is worsening.  The pain in the left leg travels as acral as the great toe, while in 
the right lower limb pain is only to the proximal leg.  She has had some physical 
therapy which she found helpful.  Epidural injection was not helpful.  There tends to 
be an increase in leg pain with prolonged sitting and walking.  Her medical history is 
remarkable for IDDM.  She smokes about a half pack of cigarettes per day.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
Smith is preserved in all myotomes.  A lumbar MRI was performed October 28, 
2021 and reveals severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally at L5-S1 and degenerative 
disc disease in the lower lumbar spine.  
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing bilateral L5 nerve root 
irritation from the severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  Given the chronicity of 
symptoms and worsening of pain, as well as her reduced functioning and impact on 
her quality of life, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

No pain produced with either flexion or extension
positive Smith's test on left
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left leg pain and into the calf and lateral 
foot.  The onset was about 5 years ago and pain comes and goes, but tends to be 
worsening.  He has had physical therapy and acupuncture without significant relief.  
He is performing exercises on a daily basis.  His medical history is unremarkable 
except for a essential hypertension.  He works in auto sales and is continuing to 
work.
The physical examination reveals findings commensurate with a left S1 
radiculopathy.  There is corresponding finding on MRI from September 6, 2021 
which reveals a left paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Pending this 
consultation, he should continue with self-directed exercises.

"
50,356,"I initially saw Ms. Smith for consultation on May 12, 2022.  She reported back 
pain and this was related to degenerative changes, with a degenerative scoliosis.  
The physical examination did not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
are no signs of radiculopathy , myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy.  MRI of the 
lumbar spine March 8, 2022 reveals advanced facet osteoarthritis and left convex 
scoliosis.  I recommended that she continue with Aquatherapy and chiropractic care.  
I also recommended blood work up.
Ms. Smith reports on follow-up that she has ongoing lower back pain.  She has 
had physical therapy, chiropractic care and exercises.  She is doing Aquatherapy 
which she has found helpful.  She has also attended at a pain clinic.  Medications 
include: Lyrica 125 mg qam, 150 mg qhs; Tylenol arthritis 1 qhs or prn; and Baclofen 
qhs.
My clinical impression remains the same.  Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back 
pain related to the degenerative scoliosis.  The conservative measures have not 
provided her the kind of relief she wishes, and she has requested a surgical 
consultation.  I think that this is reasonable and I have referred her to Dr. Smith, 
orthopaedic spine surgeon.  She can continue with the more conservative measures 
she has undergone if it provides relief.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

51,359,"At this time, given his failure to respond to conservative care, and ongoing significant 
limitations in walking and standing, as well as examination and MRI results, I am 
referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Consideration 
should be given to referring Mr. Smith to a pain clinic for medial branch/facet joint 
blocks for his lower back pain, but referral for this is deferred to his physician, as Mr. 
Wadden does not wish to travel.  He is encouraged to continue with self-directed 
exercises.

52,363,"Ms. Quick presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain to the lateral foot.  
The onset was about 1 year ago and pain is worsening.  She has not been able to 
return to work since November.  She is able to void her bladder and there is no 
perineal numbness.  Pain awakens her and she does not get restorative sleep.  Her 
medical history is remarkable for Smith.  She is on anticoagulant medication.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
There is corresponding on lumbar MRI from October 2021 which reveals a left L4-5 
synovial cyst compromising the left lateral recess.
Given the lack of response to conservative management, the leg dominance of the 
pain, functional limitations, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Ms. Quick for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Fortunately, Dr. Smith 
was in the clinic today and agreed to see Ms. Quick today.  Further comment is 
deferred to his report.  Ms. Quick should be continuing with self-directed exercises 
and activity to tolerance.

"
54,366,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock pain and right leg numbness and 
weakness.  The onset was in May 2021 with lifting.   She has limited walking and 
standing tolerance, but with the aid of a walker she can walker further.  She is able 
to get restorative sleep.  Ms. Smith has not had any physical therapies recently, but 
does attend at a pain clinic weekly and injections provide relief for a few days.  Her 
medical history is remarkable for having suffered a myocardial infarction and a 
history of essential hypertension.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L4-5 radiculopathy.  
A lumbar MRI performed October 27, 2021 reveals severe multilevel degenerative 
disc and fact joint changes.  There is multilevel lateral recess and foraminal stenosis 
at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1.  There is a degenerative right convex scoliosis.  On 
personal review there is also fairly marked right L5-S1 foraminal stenosis.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she 
should continue with self-directed exercises.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

"
55,36,"I initially saw Mr. Smith for consultation on January 28, 2022.  He was reporting left 
foot and distal leg numbness and foot drop.  Initial intense left leg pain has abated.  
Chiropractic care helped with his back pain and he was continuing with self-directed 
exercises.  The physical examination findings were commensurate with left L5 
radiculopathy.  Mr. Smith had not had any advanced imaging.  I was concerned 
regarding progressive weakness of the left foot.  A lumbar MRI was requisitioned.  
The lumbar MRI was performed at GNMI on March 21, 2022.  The cardinal findings 
are left lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis 
at L5-S1.
Mr. Smith reports that his symptoms remain the same.  He feels that his foot drop is 
worsening.  He did try using an AFO, but found it too cumbersome.  He has tripped 
on a few occasions.  There is no significant pain, but there remains numbness. Mr. 
Smith continues with self-directed exercises.  He has noticed increasing right hip pain 
for the past 6 months, and thinks it may be related to compensation while walking 
due to his left foot weakness.  This is the same hip which was replaced about 4 
years ago.
My clinical impression remains the same.  Given the progressive left foot drop and 
corresponding findings on MRI, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I also recommend that he be referred  into the rapid 
access hip and knee program for further evaluation.  He should be continuing with 
self-directed exercises.

is a burning sensation in the left buttock and proximal posterior thigh.  The onset 
was a couple of years ago and symptoms have not improved despite a course of 
physical therapy.  He describes some weakness in his right leg.  His general medical 
history is unremarkable other than hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
There is nerve root tension on the left.  A lumbar MRI was performed October 22, 
2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1, and bilateral 
recess stenosis at L4-5.
In view of the persisting leg dominant pain and lack of improvement despite 
conservative care, as well as the examination and MRI findings, limited walking and 
impact on his quality of life, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, Mr. Smith should be continuing with self-directed

57,373,"Ms. Smith is reporting lower back and right leg pain which began as a result of a 
fall in November 2019.  She has not experienced improvement. She has recently 
begun physical therapy and it is too early to say if it's helping.  Her general medical 
history is essentially unremarkable.  She is osteopenic.  The physical examination 
does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There is no nerve root tension.
MRI of the lumbar spine performed April 26, 2022 reveals 70% compression fracture 
of L1.  There is a small left L4-5 disc protrusion with abutment of the left L5 nerve 
root.
My clinical impression is that she has mechanical lower back pain related in part to 
the compression fracture.  At this time, I have encouraged her to continue with the 
physical therapy and self-directed exercises.  I am referring her for a spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha, to determine if she might be a candidate for 
kyphoplasty.  If leg symptoms persist, then consideration should be given to EMG 
investigation.

Pain produced with Extension
N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left leg pain.  The onset was 
about 8 years ago and symptoms are worsening.  Her medical history is 
unremarkable.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant motor deficit.  There 
are left leg radicular symptoms and diminished sensation over the left L5 
dermatome, suggestive of left L5 nerve root involvement.  This is likely related to 
severe foraminal and lateral recess stenosis noted on MRI at the left L4-5 level.  On 
physical examination there are decreased range of motion of the hips, but plain film 
radiographs today only reveal mild degenerative changes.
At this time, in view of the persisting left leg pain and MRI findings, and affect that 
pain is having on her functioning, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Pending this consultation, she may wish to trial a 6

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left more than right lower back pain.  The 
onset was in March 2020 and he attributes it to a viral infection which affected other 
body areas.  He says that pain is worsening.  He has found transient relief with 
physical therapy and chiropractic care, and he continues with self-directed exercises.  
He is able to obtain restorative sleep.  Mr. Smith has been attending with Dr. Smith for injections (sounds like epidurals?) which he says provides him relief for a 
few weeks.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There are no nerve root tension signs.  Hip ranges of motion are good with no signs 
of internal derangement.  Mr. Smith has a marked left antalgia and anterior list of his 
torso.  This is related to a degenerative lumbar scoliosis.  On review of the MRI from 
April 2021 there is some lateral listhesis and the most prominent changes are in the 
lower lumbar spine.
Mr. Smith presents in some physical distress and cannot walk without the aid of a 
walker.  His pain levels can be intense and he relates that the back condition is 
affecting his quality of life.  Notwithstanding that his pain is back dominant and the 
examination findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr.

clinical impression was that she had a left L3 radiculopathy.  There was 
corresponding finding on MRI of severe left L3-4 foraminal stenosis.  I have referred 
her for a selective left L3 nerve root block for diagnostic confirmation.  
There was some concern about taking her of her blood thinners.  She nevertheless 
did so for 3 days and has had some type of image guided injections which she feels 
helped.  She has been attending with a new physical therapist for 3 sessions now.  
Ms. Smith reports to me that she is scheduled to have an MRI of her left hip and 
a bone scan.
Ms. Smith continues to have significant limitation in her walking tolerance and

back pain at nighttime, along with numbness in her hands and arms.  Ms. Smith has 
attended at the Minerva Pain Clinic and had injections without significant relief.  She 
has also seen a vascular specialist who has ruled out a vascular cause to her leg 
symptoms.  Her medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia.
On physical examination Ms. Smith presented in a wheelchair.  She said that she could 
not dorsiflex her feet and power was negligible to resisted testing.  Otherwise power 
was rated 5/5 L2-S1 bilaterally in the lower limbs.  There are no nerve root tension 
signs.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles 
bilaterally.  There is no spasticity, clonus or other signs of myelopathy.
A lumbar MRI was performed in July 2020 and reveals spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 
and L4-5.  
At this point, given the ongoing back and leg pains, and limited walking and standing 
tolerance, I have requisitioned an updated lumbar MRI.  I will be following up with 
Ms. Smith afterwards.  In the interim, she should continue with activity to tolerance.  
She also complained of ""lumps"" subdermal in her back and consideration could be 
given to referring her for a dermatological consultation.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain and in December 2021 
developed right foot drop.  He says that he has had a few falls.  His medical history 
is remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, severe depression and PTSD.  He has been 
on long term disability for 3 years.  He has limited sitting and walking tolerance of 5 
to 10 minutes.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is weakness of right foot dorsiflexion and EHL.  A lumbar MRI performed 
February 24, 2022 reveals severe right foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and right L4-5 
disc protrusion and compromise of the right lateral recess.
Given the persisting and debilitating right leg pain and weakness, as well as MRI, I 
am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was in 
March 2021 and symptoms are worsening.  He has attended for massage, traction, 
physical therapy and chiropractic care without relief.  He has had a few injections 
(described epidural and facet joint block) without relief.  Pain sometimes disturbs his 
sleep.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is no nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was performed July 9, 2021 in Buffalo and 
this reveals a broad-based disc protrusion at L4-5 and L5-S1 without neural 
compression.  There is moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 bilaterally.
Given the back dominance of his pain, Mr. Smith may not be the best surgical 
candidate.  However, he has almost exhausted conservative options and the pain 
remains debilitating.  There are degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.  
Given this, and after exploring for his expectations, we agreed on a surgical 
consultation.  I am referring Mr. Smith to Dr. Smith for his opinion.  At the 
same time, I am referring Mr. Smith to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for 
consideration of medial branch blocks.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith to 
follow-up with his physician for pain control options.  I query whether something like 
Tramadol may proffer him some relief.  He should continue with self-directed 
exercises.

78,396,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right lower back and leg pain to the calf.  
The onset was in September 2021 and she fell in October 2021 which exacerbated 
her pain.  Physical therapy and chiropractic care was not helpful.  Ms. Smith feels 
that her recovery has plateaued.  Exercises provide temporary relief and she 
continues to attend for physical therapy twice per week.  Her medical history 
includes anxiety and MS.  Ms. Smith has not been able to return to work since 
October 2021.
The physical examination reveals findings commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is straight leg raising on the right.  There is subtle weakness of the right EHL.  
A lumbar MRI was performed February 8, 2022 which reveals a disc protrusion at 
L4-5 and L5-S1 with abutment of nerve roots.
Given the ongoing leg pain and lack of significant relief with conservative care, as 
well as the examination findings and MRI results, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Concurrently, I have requisitioned an EMG for 
additional diagnostic clarification.  Consideration could also be given to referring Ms. 
Oakes for epidural injection as this may proffer some relief, albeit possibly 
transiently.

Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of leg heaviness and numbness, with burning 
sensation in her feet.  The symptoms are chronic, but increased over the past year.  
She has tried chiropractic care.  She does not report any change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  Her medical history is remarkable 
for breast cancer and chemotherapy.  This may have led to some of the paresthesia 
she is experiencing in her feet.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  There is no 
significant motor deficit, except for mild weakness of the left flexor halluces. A 
lumbar MRI was performed March 24, 2021 reveals a Grade II spondylolisthesis at 
L5-S1 with severe canal stenosis.
Given the worsening leg heaviness and numbness, and burning in her feet, as well

tender lumbo-sacral junction
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of lower back pain and secondarily right 
leg pain.  The onset was a few years ago and pain is worsening.  She reports that 
she attended for chiropractic care a couple of years ago which helped a little.  More 
recently she has had medial branch blocks which did not help.  Exercises are not 
helping.  She states that her walking tolerance is only 5 to 10 minutes and pain is 
affecting her quality of life.  She has non-restorative sleep due to pain.  Ms. Smith's 
health history is unremarkable.  She does have a history of osteoporosis.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There are no motor deficits.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 23, 2021 and 
reveals a Grade I spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 with significant facet degeneration and 
foraminal stenosis bilaterally.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing mechanical (lumbo-sacral) 
lower back pain and likely irritation of the right L5 nerve root that is causing the leg 
pain.  Given her failure to adequately respond to more conservative measures, 
involving chiropractic care and facet joint/medial branch blocks, as well as the 
worsening pain and MRI findings, I think it reasonable that we obtain a surgical 
opinion as to whether she may be a candidate for a lumbo-sacral fusion.  I am 
referring Ms. Smith to Dr. D. Guha for his expert opinion.  In the interim, Ms. Smith 
should continue with self-directed exercises to maintain her current levels of mobility

88,426,"Ms. Smith presents today with a complaint of left more than right lower back pain, 
and left leg numbness.  The onset of symptoms was a few years ago and pain 
seems to be worsening.  The back pain is characterized as an achiness.  Ms. Smith 
does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal 
numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She has tried physical therapy without relief, and 
she sees her chiropractor periodically for treatment which is helpful.  Ms. Smith 
says that she has not had any injections.  Her health in general is reportedly good.  
She is not gainfully employed and is able to manage chores at home.
The physical examination findings reveals that she walks with a normal gait.  There 
is no antalgia.  There is an increase in back pain with lumbar flexion.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is 5/5 L2 to S1, except 
for mild (4+/5) weakness of the left EHL.  Sensation is also mild reduced on the left 
L5 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is no 
clonus/spasticity or other long tract signs. Hoffman's sign is absent and upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Supine straight leg raising did not create neural tension, but slump 
test was positive on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 13, 2020.  The cardinal finding is left L4-5 
disc protrusion with compromise of the left L5 nerve root and degenerative disc 
disease at L5-S1 which is fairly advanced.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing discogenic lower back pain 
and there are some residual signs of right L5 radiculopathy.  She still has some 
paresthesia in the left leg.  At this point, given the back dominance to her pain, she 
may not be the best surgical candidate, but given her concerns about becoming 
completely disabled and the degenerative changes noted in the lower lumbar spine, I 
feel it is appropriate that we seek spine surgical consultation.  I am referring Ms. 
Smith for consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I also recommend that her physician 
consider referring her to a pain clinic for epidural injection which may proffer her 
some relief.  She does not drive, therefore I defer to her physician to refer her 
somewhere in Burlington.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises.  She could trial a back support belt for when she is 
performing more physically demanding activities.  Ms. Smith has found some 
benefit from chiropractic care and she can continue with this if she continues to find 
benefit.

present for a couple of months and is worsening.  Ms. Smith has a history of 
chronic lower back pain, and experienced an acute flare-up in April prompting a visit 
to ER.  She was in hospital for 6 days and had epidural injections which did not help.  
She did see Dr. Smith at that time, but given that her pain was mostly lower back 
dominant and she had not yet had the epidural, he recommended this and a course 
of physical therapy.  Ms. Smith's health history includes insulin dependent 
diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She has been unable to exercise due to 
pain.  She does feel that she is unable to completely void her bladder, but there is no 
report of perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.
The physical examination reveals diminished right patellar reflex and weakness to 
resisted right foot dorsiflexion (4+/5).  There is a positive straight leg raise on the 
right.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no 
spasticity or clonus.  A lumbar MRI was performed April 5, 2022 and reveals cardinal 
findings of right L4-5 extraforaminal disc extrusion with severe foraminal stenosis, 
and impingement of the right L4 nerve root.  There is a right L3-4 disc osteophyte 
complex with displacement of the right L3 nerve root.  There is a calcified disc at 
L1-2 with moderate to severe canal stenosis.  The most clinically relevant finding in 
my opinion is the foraminal disc extrusion at L4-5.  Ms. Smith has extensive 
degenerative disc and facet joint degeneration and this is contributory to her history 
of chronic lower back pain.

There is moderate canal and left foraminal stenosis at L3-4 and mild canal recess 
stenosis at L4-5.  There is significant left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 on personal 
review of images.
Ms. Smith clinical presentation is somewhat atypical for neurogenic 
claudication.  She has a degenerative lumbar spine with scoliosis which is 
contributing to the lower back pain.  There is stenosis which is likely causing her

tolerance of 5 to 10 minutes. She reports that her balance is declining. Ms. Smith 
has had physical therapy without relief.  Her general medical history is 
unremarkable.  She is a non-smoker.
The physical examination reveals that she is neurologically intact with no signs of 
radiculopathy or florid myelopathy. She is hyper reflexic at the patellae and has a 
positive Smith test.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  In the upper limbs 
reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no spasticity or clonus in the 
upper or lower limbs.  A cervical and thoracic MRI was performed January 12, 2022.  
The most concerning finding is at T6-7.  There is a disc protrusion and advanced 
cord compression, but with no signs of signal change.  There is moderate spinal 
canal stenosis at C5-6.
Ms. Smith is reasonably functional at this time and is still able to work, but is 
reporting balance difficulties.  There are subtle signs of myelopathy and findings on 
MRI of cord compression at T6-7.  Given this, I think it appropriate that we seek a 
spine surgical opinion.  I am referring Ms. Smith for consultation with Dr. Smith (I had the opportunity to review the MRI images with Dr. Smith today).  I

There is not so much pain, but the weakness and lack of control of his legs and feet 
is his main concern.  He cannot walk without the aid of a walker.  He did not report 
any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  He 
was also reporting neck pain.  Mr. Smith has attended for physical therapy without 
relief.  He relates disrupted sleep due to neck pain.  Mr. Smith has very significant 
challenges with performing chores due to his mobility issues.  He has standing 
tolerance of less than 5 minutes, and walking of 5 to 10 minutes (with support).  His 
general medical history is unremarkable other than hypertension and heart arythmia.  
Mr. Smith presented using a walker.  His gait is spastic. The physical examination 
findings reveal patellar reflexes to be 3+.  Achilles were 1+.  There is preserved 
power of knee and hip flexion and extension, but there is profound weakness of foot 
dorsi and plantar flexion to resisted testing.  Vibration sense is absent in his feet.  
Superficial sensation is also significantly reduced.  There is a positive Smith's 
test.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  In the upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no dysdiadokokinesia.
A lumbar MRI was performed December 16, 2021.  There is severe canal and 
foraminal stenosis at L3-4, mild to moderate canal stenosis at L2-3 and L4-5, 
moderate left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1, and moderate to severe left foraminal 
stenosis at L2-3.  Images were reviewed with Mr. Smith.
I diagnosed Mr. Smith with acquired lumbar spinal stenosis which is fairly significant 
and he will require a surgical opinion.  However, I was concerned regarding long 
tract signs and about the potential for spinal cord compression in the thoracic or 
cervical spine, which would be of more concern at this point, rather than his lumbar 
spine.  MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was required.  Mr. Smith was advised to 
continue with activity to tolerance and continue to use supports for walking.
On follow-up today Mr. Smith says that his symptoms remain the same.  He is not 
taking pain relieving medications.  The cervical and thoracic MRI's were performed

98,447,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation on June 16, 2022.  He presented with a 
complaint of lower back pain which began in November 2021 with a fall on the buttocks.  
He has had persisting pain since.  The pain is bilateral with variable intensity.  Standing and 
sitting are exacerbating, and relief is obtained with lying down and application of heat.  He 
had not had any therapy and was not doing any exercises.  Mr. Smith does not have any 
significant leg pain, but has occasional thigh pain.  His medical history includes diabetes, 
essential hypertension and dyslipidemia.  He is a non-smoker.  The physical examination 
revealed Mr. Smith to be neurologically intact.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+. Power is 
graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  There is no 
spasticity or clonus.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent.  Smith test is normal.  A lumbar MRI was performed 
April 7, 2022 and reveals a compression fracture of L1 with 90% loss of height and 4 mm 
retropulsion.  There is an L4-5 disc protrusion eccentric to the right.  Mr. Smith is status 
post L1 compression fracture with ongoing lower back pain.  His back pain was located in 
the lower lumbar spine caudal to the site of L1 and I felt that some therapy may help.
The CT was performed July 15, 2022.  The findings again reveal the compression fracture at 
L1 with no significant interval change.  There is no significant canal or neuroforaminal 
narrowing.
Mr. Smith is continuing to have lower back pain.  He has had a couple of sessions of 
chiropractic care with some relief.  He continues with self-directed exercises.  He is able to 
complete his ADLs but with difficulty.
At this time given some improvement with treatment I recommended he continue, and be 
regularly performing self-directed exercises.  There is no identified need for surgical 
consultation at this time.  I will be following up with Mr. Smith in several months.  On 
follow-up August 17, 2022 Mr. Smith reported having begun chiropractic care which 
seemed to be helping.  I recommended that I follow-up with him in several months.
Mr. Smith says that had some chiropractic care and has an appointment with a pain clinic 
next week.  Despite this, his pain remains the same.  There is no significant leg pain.  My 
clinical impresion remains the same.  Given the compression fracture I am referring Mr. 
Howey to Dr. D. Guha to determine whether he may be a candidate for kyphoplasty.

99,450,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain and secondarily leg 
pain/numbness.  The onset of symptoms was in May 2021.  There is an increase in 
leg paresthesia with walking and relief with sitting.  He is able to get restorative 
sleep.  He continues with self-directed exercises.  Mr. Smith has not had any recent 
physical therapy.  He is not taking any pain relieving medications.  His medical history 
is remarkable for bilateral hip replacements and prostate cancer.  Mr. Smith is 
retired and is able to manage chores at home.
The physical examination findings reveal the right patellar reflex to be 1+ while other 
reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 5/5, except for the right quadriceps which is 4+/5.  
Sensation is diminished along the right L3 and L4 dermatomes.  There is no nerve 
root tension with supine straight leg raising.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is 
negative Hoffman's sign.  There is no spasticity or clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed January 2, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L4-5.  There is significant right lateral recess stenosis at L3-4.  There is a 
degenerative scoliosis.
Mr. Smith presents with neurogenic claudication and symptoms and signs of right 
L3-4 radiculopathy.  His back pain is mechanical in nature.  Given the ongoing 
symptoms and functional limitations, including limited walking and standing 
tolerance, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed exercises.

"
100,451,"Mr. Smith was seen for consultation initially on June 17, 2022.  He presented with 
a complaint of worsening left leg weakness and foot drop.  He had had painful 
paresthesia in the left leg for years.  He underwent an L2-3 lumbar fusion in 2018.  
Mr. Smith had been attending for physical therapy months and had massage 
therapy at first.  He reported a limited walking tolerance of 5 to 10 minutes, and 
standing of less than 5 minutes.  He was able to get restorative sleep.  The physical 
examination findings revealed profound weakness of resisted left foot dorsiflexion 
and EHL.  There was no nerve root tension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the 
patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation was diminished along the left L4 and L5 
dermatomes.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
There is no clonus or spasticity.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.
A lumbar MRI was performed in 2016 (prior to his decompression/fusion in 2018) 
and this reveals moderate to severe canal stenosis at L2-3.  I diagnosed Mr. 
Smith with a left L4/5 radiculopathy and progressive foot drop.  An updated MRI 
had been requisitioned and I recommended to Mr. Smith that I follow-up with him 
after the MRI.
The MRI was performed at GNMI on July 18, 2022.  There is artifact from prior 
surgery at L2-3.  At L4-5 there is severe spinal canal stenosis from a combination of 
degenerative changes.  
My clinical impression remains the same.  Given the MRI findings of severe canal 
stenosis at L4-5, ongoing leg dominant pain and weakness and impact on his quality 
of life, I have referred Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to 
tolerance.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

"
101,452,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right more than left leg pain.  The pain 
in the right leg is at the lateral leg and into the dorsum of the right foot.  The onset 
was in October 2021 and he says that he has experienced a little improvement.  The 
pain tends to be worse at the end of the day and Mr. Smith says that he has limited 
walking tolerance of 5 to 10 minutes.  He has seen a neurologist, Dr. Smith, who felt 
that site of his prior surgery (L5-S1 disc replacement) has resulted in scarring and 
perhaps arachnoiditis, and is causing radicular symptoms.  Mr. Smith has been 
attending for physical therapy for upper back pain.  His medical history includes 
having had an MI and cardiac stents, dyslipidemia, and as noted he has had prior 
L5-S1 disc replacement.  He is retired and able to manage chores at home. 
Medications include Lyrica, Plavix, a statin, cyclobenzaprine, and Tylenol 3 prn.
The physical examination findings reveal patellar and Achilles reflexes to be 2+.  
Power is graded 5/5 except for resisted right EHL and flexor halluces which are 4+/5.  
Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical  Sensation is preserved and symmetrical.  
There is nerve root tension on the right with straight leg raising and slump test.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is no clonus or spasticity.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally and there are no other long 
tract signs.  There is pain with costovertebral joint challenge in the mid thoracic on 
the left over rib angles.
A lumbar MRI was performed January 26, 0222.  There is moderate bilateral 
foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  There is mild to moderate foraminal stenosis at L2-3 and 
L3-4, and mild right foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of right L5/S1 radiculopathy.  He has 
had prior surgery at L5-S1 (disc replacement) and (in view of prior surgery and 
possible scar tissue) while he may not be the best of surgical candidates, given the 
ongoing right leg pain and my examination findings, consultation is appropriate.  I 
am referring him to Dr. Smith for his expert opinion.  Concurrently, Mr. Smith 
may find relief with pulsed radiofrequency ablation of the right L5 dorsal root 
ganglion and I am referring him to the Bloor Pain Clinic for evaluation and 
consideration for intervention.  They may also want to address his upper back pain 
which I feel is related to costo-vertebral joint irritation/costovertebral syndrome.  Mr. 
Smith should continue with self-directed exercises, and physical therapy if he finds 
relief, and may wish to consider a trial of 10 sessions of spinal 
mobilization/manipulation for his upper back pain.

"
102,454,"Ms. Smith presents with a history of left leg pain.  The onset was in October 2020, 
initially starting as buttock pain and then into the left lower limb.  The pain currently 
is mostly in the posterior thigh and lateral foot, and there is numbness in the foot.  
Ms. Smith has been attending for chiropractic care which she does find helpful.  
She has also been receiving epidural injections every 3 months which are helpful.  
Overall, however, she feels as if her recovery has plateaued.  Ms. Smith's medical 
history is unremarkable.  She does not smoke.  She works as an accountant.  She 
reports that she has limited standing, sitting and walking tolerance of 5 to 10 
minutes.  She is unable to do more physically demanding chores at home.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left S1 radiculopathy.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ except for the left Achilles which is 1+.  Power is 
graded 5/5 except for repeat left single leg calf raise which revealed 
weakness/fatigue.  Sensation is reduced along the left S1 dermatome.  There is a 
positive left straight leg raise and slump test.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent.  There is no spasticity or clonus.  
A lumbar MRI was performed April 1, 2022 and reveals a large left L5-S1 disc 
extrusion with significant compromise of the left lateral recess.
Given the persisting left leg dominant pain, the examination findings, MRI results and 
the continuing impact that the leg pain is having on Ms. Smith's quality of life, I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She can 
continue with chiropractic care if she finds benefit.  She should also continue to see 
her interventionalist, Dr. Smith, as she has found benefit from the procedures.  Ms. 
Smith should be continuing with self-directed exercises at home.

103,455,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  The leg 
symptoms are most troublesome, and worse on the left.  The onset of leg pain was 
in December 2021 and he relates that pain and functional difficulties are worsening.  
He has standing and walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  He has attended for 
physical therapy and acupuncture which he has not found helpful, but an epidural in 
April was helpful for a few weeks.  Mr. Smith's health history is otherwise good.  
He says that recent blood work did not reveal any abnormalities.  He has had prior 
lumbar discectomy at L4-5 in the remote past.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant abnormality.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are symmetrical.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  
Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and 
Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 7, 2022 at GNMI.  The cardinal finding is 
severe spinal canal stenosis at L2-3 and L3-4 from a combination of degenerative 
changes.  
Mr. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication and has significant functional 
limitations at this point.  Given this and MRI findings, I am referring him for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He has been encouraged to continue with 
flexion-based exercises and activity to tolerance in the interim.

104,458,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The onset was 
a few years ago and pain is not improving.  He reports having limited standing 
tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  He is usually able to sleep without difficulty.  Mr. 
Smith has had chiropractic care (spinal manipulation and acupuncture) without 
relief.  He is not performing exercises regularly.  He health in general is good.  He 
smokes about 1 pack of cigarettes per day.
The physical examination reveals findings consistent with left L5 radiculopathy.  
There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  There is weakness (4+/5) of the left 
EHL.  Power is otherwise preserved 5/5 in all myotomes.  Sensation is reduced in the 
left L5 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is no 
spasticity or clonus.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 15, 2022 and reveals severe foraminal stenosis 
at L5-S1 bilaterally, left more than right.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of a right L5 radiculopathy.  There is 
corresponding finding on MRI.  Given the ongoing leg dominant pain and functional 
limitations, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith 
for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also referred him for a 
transforaminal epidural steroid injection at L5-S1 for pain relief. I have 
recommended that he continue with self-directed, flexion-based exercises.

"
105,460,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain and weakness.  He relates that 
most of the pain is about the right knee, but there is also heaviness of the leg and it 
can give way.  He relates that he has been using a cane for about 1 year to improve 
his stability.  Mr. Smith relates that his walking tolerance is only about 20 years.  His 
sleep is not disrupted.  His medical history is remarkable for a myocardial infarction 
and stent.
The physical examination significant mobility issues.  Mr. Smith reports that his 
walking tolerance is only about 20 yards.  He presented today in a wheelchair.  The 
examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  Power is preserved 
at 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished in the right foot in a 
non-dermatomal distribution.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ bilaterally at the 
Patellae and Achilles.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  There 
is no spasticity or clonus, or other signs of myelopathy.  There is hypertrophy of the 
right knee joint and tenderness about the knee and joint lines.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed March 4, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5, L3-4 and 
L2-3 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is significant buckling of 
nerve roots at the conus.
It is my clinical impression that Mr. Smith is experiencing unilateral neurogenic 
claudication.  Much of his ambulation difficulties however may in fact be from the 
arthritic right knee for which he is to undergo a knee replacement.  He says that a 
surgical date has yet to be established.
At this time, given the deterioration of his functioning and MRI findings, and not 
withstanding the concomitant right knee issue, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

106,464,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain and lower back pain.  The 
onset was about 10 years ago when he fell about 40 feet, sustained an L1 vertebral 
body fracture.  He was getting right gluteal and calf pain, but reports feeling much 
better since taking Lyrica.  Physical therapy and osteopathy were helpful.  His 
medical history includes diabetes and dyslipidemia.  He is a non-smoker.  
Medications include metformin, ozempic and jardiance.  Mr. Smith works as a 
Boiler Technician.  He was off work for 2 months, but is currently working full time.
The physical examination reveals normal gait and Mr. Smith was not using any 
supports.  There is an increase in lower back pain with lumbar spine extension.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is 
graded 5/5 L2 to S1, except for the right EHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Supine straight 
leg raising and slump testing are both non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion were 
normal.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 17, 2022.  There is a Grade I anterolisthesis of 
L5 on S1.  There is severe foraminal stenosis.  Noted is the chronic compression 
fracture of L1 with mild retropulsion of the superior corner.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5 radiculopathy.  Given the ongoing leg 
pain which his chronic, as well as MRI findings, and notwithstanding that he has 
experienced some improvement with Lyrica, I am referring him for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  Mr. Smith should continue with self-directed 
exercises.

107,467,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The pain is chronic for 
about 10 years and worsening. At this time the pain is affecting his quality of life, 
and he relates limited standing tolerance.  Pain is disturbing his sleep and he has an 
increase in pain with lying down.  He has done physical therapy, massage, 
osteopathy and chiropractic care.  He relates that chiropractic care helps a little.  He 
takes OxyContin qhs for pain relief.  He did have a medial branch block which helped 
for about a month.  He is scheduled for follow-up in December 2022.  Other 
medications include dutasteride, rosuvastatin, afluzosin, and edarbi.  Mr. Smith 
reports a secondary complaint of numbness through the left anterior thigh.  His 
medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
Reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in 
all dermatomes.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  There are no long tract 
signs.  There is tenderness at the lumbosacral level, and there is a positive Smith's 
test (lumbar rotation with extension) on the left.  A lumbar MRI was performed 
September 4, 2021 which reveals degenerative disc disease.  The cardinal finding is 
at L5-S1 where there is advanced L5-S1 degeneration, modic changes of endplates 
and on personal review the disc collapse is more prominent on the left.
Mr. Smith has mechanical back pain related to the degenerative changes at L5-S1.  
Typically, the best surgical outcomes are for leg dominant pain.  In this case, 
however, given the worsening lower back pain and disabling nature of pain, as well 
as imaging and examination findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith to determine if he might be a candidate for a 
lumbo-sacral fusion.  Lumbar plain film radiographs were performed today in 
preparation of that consultation.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that he 
follow-up with the pain clinic.  He should be continuing with self-directed exercises, 
and can continue with chiropractic care if he finds relief.

right leg pain.  There is an increase in pain with walking and standing, and relief 
with sitting.  He does not have any significant lower back pain.  He has had physical 
therapy without relief.  He tries to exercise, but his walking tolerance is limited to 5 
to 10 minutes.  Mr. Smith that the unrelenting pain is affecting his mood.  His 
medical history is otherwise good.  He has had total knee replacement bilaterally.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left unilateral neurogenic 
claudication and L5 radiculopathy.  There is weakness of the left EHL at 4+/5, but 
otherwise power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at

122,500,"Ms. Smith presents with a constellation of symptoms including lower back, groin 
pain, left thigh pain and lower extremity weakness.  She describes urinary frequency 
and incomplete voiding of her bladder.  There is an increase in pain with standing, 
sitting and walking.  The majority of her pain is in the left thigh.  Physical therapy 
was not helpful.  Ms. Smith relates very limited walking tolerance and she is using 
walking sticks.  Her symptoms are worsening.  She relates that she has seen an 
internist and neurologist.  An MRI of the lumbar spine and pelvis has been ordered.  
Her medical history is rather unremarkable.  Her surgical history includes a stent in 
the left subclavian artery.
The physical examination findings reveal the left patellar reflex to be a little sluggish 
compared to the right.  There is a positive slump test on the left, and positive 
femoral nerve stretch test on the left.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There are no long tract/pyramidal signs.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed May 4, 2021 and reveals degenerative disc changes.  There is a slight 
disc protrusion on the left at L2-3.  Ms. Smith had an EMG study, but the results 
are not available today.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing a left L3 radiculopathy.  
This diagnosis would not explain all of her symptoms, including reported weakness 
and very limited walking tolerance.  She is to have an updated MRI and follow up 
with her neurologist.  I have recommended that I could follow-up with her after that.  
At this point there is nothing from the examination or imaging to date that would 
prompt me to refer her for a spine surgical consultation.  The constellation of

124,502,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation on July 5, 2021.  He was reporting left 
leg pain to the ankle, and also lower back pain.  Symptoms had been present for 
more than a year.  He had undergone physical therapy, traction and acupuncture 
without relief.  He had injections at a pain clinic with only temporary relief.  His 
health history was only remarkable for high uric acid levels.  The only medications he 
was taking were Ibuprofen prn, and Allopurinol.  The pain was having a significant 
impact on his quality of life and cannot ski or walk for distance.  The physical 
examination revealed normal gait and no antalgia.  He could not perform toe walking 
or single leg calf raise on the left due to weakness.  Sensation was diminished along 
the left L4 dermatome.  There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  Hip ranges 
of motion were within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes were 2+ and Hoffman's 
sign was absent bilaterally.  A lumbar MRI was performed January 24, 2022.  There 
is moderate to severe right and moderate left foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  There is 
degenerative disc bulging at L4-5 and L5-S1.  My clinical impression was that Mr. 
Vickers had left L4 and S1 radiculopathy, and there may be neuropathic pain.  I 
referred him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith and recommended 
EMG study.  I recommended that he continue with self-directed exercises.
Mr. Smith reports that he continues to experience left leg pain and weakness.  He 
is beginning to experience some pain on the right.  He is still performing self-directed 
exercises and is able to bike.  He feels that his symptoms are slightly worse than 
when I saw him.  He is not taking any pain relieving medications regularly.  His 
overall health remains the same.
My clinical impression remains the same.  He is awaiting a surgical consultation.  I 
recommend that consideration be given to referring him for neurology consultation 
and also for referral for epidural injection.  Perhaps he can discuss with his current 
interventionalist.  I recommend that an updated lumbar MRI be considered given his 
worsening symptoms.  I would be pleased to follow-up with him afterwards should 
this be requisitioned.

130,518,"I initially saw Ms. Smith on July 11, 2022.  She reported left leg pain which began about 1 
year prior as lower back pain.  She had experienced improvement with the leg pain, 
although she had residual numbness and tingling at the lateral foot and thigh.  There was 
occasional pain in the left gluteal and posterior thigh area.  Physical therapy had been 
helpful, and she was continuing with home-based exercises.  She was not taking any pain 
relieving medications.  She had been diagnosed with a left hip labral tear and was 
scheduled to have a steroid injection.  Her medical history is unremarkable except for 
hypothyroidism for which she takes Synthroid.  She does not take any pain relieving 
medication.  Ms. Smith had returned to her work as a Program Manager on a graduated

There was diminished left Achilles reflex.  Power is 5/5 L2 to S1, except for some weakness 
of the left EHL and FHL.  There is diminished sensation along the left L5 and S1 
dermatomes.  There is some left thigh nerve root tension with left SLR.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.  A lumbar MRI was performed March 24, 2022 and reveals a large left L5-S1 disc 
herniation with S1 nerve root displacement.  Given the improvement and response to 
physical therapies, I have recommended that she continue with this, along with self-
directed exercises.

lower back is feeling better, but she still has pain in the left buttock and leg which is 
intermittent.  There is persisting numbness in the foot.  She is continuing with exercises and 
pilates.  She feels that her recovery has plateaued at this time.  The physical examination 
findings today are substantially similar to when I initially saw her.  Given this, the ongoing 
impact on her quality of life, and in consideration of the MRI findings and large left L5-S1

Pain produced with Flexion
N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left leg pain.  The onset was in January 
2021 as a result of a fall.  The leg pain intensified after endometriosis surgery in 
October.  She has been receiving intramuscular injections which only help a little.  
She is also seeing a chiropractor weekly and treatment helps with her mobility.  
Overall, her leg pain is not substantively improved.  Her health in general is good 
other than a history of endometriosis and hypertension.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with a left S1 radiculopathy.  
There are nerve root tension signs.  A lumbar MRI performed November 14, 2021

Mr. Smith was seen today on a request for expedited consultation from Dr. Smith.  Mr. Smith presents with his wife.  He has limited walking and standing 
tolerance (less than 5 minutes) and was in a wheelchair.  He is reporting limited 
walking tolerance, but his chief complaint is weakness and incoordination.  The onset 
of symptoms was about 5 months ago.  He also has lower back pain.  He has 
diabetes and has a history of a remote brain injury.  He smokes about 1.5 packs of 
cigarettes per day. 
The physical examination findings reveal long tract/pyramidal signs.  There are 
upgoing toes bilaterally.  He has dysdiadikokinesia.  There is a positive Hoffman's 
sign on the right.  Patellar and upper limb reflexes are hyperreflexic.  He has weak 
grip strength on the right.  Mr. Smith has balance problems and could not heel/toe 
walk.
The findings are commensurate with cervical spine myelopathy, likely from a 
spondylotic process.  He has some mechanical lower back pain, and I would not rule 
out lumbar stenosis, but the main concern at this time is the cervical spine.  Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon, was in the clinic today and kindly saw Mr. 
Smith.  An expedited cervical spine MRI was requisitioned.  Mr. Smith will be 
following up with Mr. Smith and there is no need for follow-up with my self at this

133,68,"I initially saw Mr. Smith for consultation February 10, 2022.  He was reporting 
paresthesia in his feet and legs, and pain in his buttocks.  The onset was a few years 
ago and symptoms were worsening, despite having tried chiropractic care and 
physical therapy.  He had also had injections.  Doppler study of the lower limbs was 
reportedly normal.  His symptoms used to be present only with walking and 
prolonged standing, but now they are more constant.  The clinical presentation was 
consistent with neurogenic claudication.  The physical examination does not reveal 
any significant neurological deficit, other than mildly weak right EHL.  An MRI of the 
lumbar spine was performed in 2018 which reveals canal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5.  
An updated MRI was required.
The updated lumbar MRI was performed February 25, 2022 and reveals severe 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  
At this time, Mr. Smith says that his symptoms remain the same and leg pain is 
worse on the right.  He has limited walking and standing tolerance.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, functional limitations and MRI results, I am 
referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the 
interim, he should continue with self-directed flexion based exercises.

134,69,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation on February 10, 2022.  He reported 
intermittent left buttock pain, and previously had left leg pain which resolved.  He 
had experienced significant improvement.  Mr. Smith has a prior history of lower 
back pain which has responded to chiropractic care.  He was continuing to perform 
home based exercises regularly.  His health in general is essentially unremarkable.  
The physical examination findings did not reveal any significant motor deficit, other 
than diminished left patellar reflex.  There is no nerve root tension.  MRI of his 
lumbar spine was performed May 28, 2019 reveals moderate to severe canal 
stenosis at L4-5 and left foraminal stenosis at the same level.  My clinical impression 
was that Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of a left L4 radiculopathy.  Given the 
improvement, and notwithstanding the MRI findings, there was no identified need for 
updated advanced imaging or referral for surgical consultation.  
Mr. Smith says that since I saw him in February his condition has declined.  There 
is significantly more pain.  He has attended for physical therapy on three occasions, 
massage and acupuncture without relief.  Most of the pain currently is in the left 
buttock and bilateral leg pain and heaviness.  There is an increase in pain with 
walking and standing, and relief with sitting.  Symptoms are not too bad at night and 
he indicates getting restful sleep.  He is taking Pregabalin 50 mg bid for pain relief.
The physical examination findings reveals power to be 5/5 L2 to S1.  There is 
symmetrical muscle tone and bulk.  Reflexes are 1+ except for the right patellar 
reflex which is 2+.  Muscle tone and bulk is normal and symmetrical.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is no clonus or 
spasticity.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain and the impact on his functioning, as well as 
MRI findings, I have referred Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also requisitioned an updated lumbar MRI, but a requisition could

135,74,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation  February 10, 2022.  He was reporting 
lower back and leg pain, tingling and numbness.  The symptoms began a few years 
ago and are worsening.  He has limited walking tolerance of about 50 yards.  Sitting 
provides relief.  Chiropractic care and physical therapy helped a little at first.  He has 
also tried laser therapy and acupuncture.  He had had an epidural injection which 
helped with lower back pain.   The physical examination did not reveal any significant 
neurological deficit, other than diminished right patellar reflex.  Symptoms are 
consistent with neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar MRI was performed August 5, 
2020 and the cardinal finding is severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5, and severe right 
foraminal stenosis with impingement of the right L4 nerve root.  There is some canal 
stenosis at L3-4 and left lateral recess stenosis at L5-S1.  An updated MRI was 
requisitioned.
The MRI was performe June 2, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 
with moderate to severe foraminal stenosis.  There is severe L3-4 canal stenosis.
Mr. Smith reports that his symptoms remain unchanged.  He has limited standing 
and walking tolerance.  He continues with self-directed exercises.  Mr. Smith has 
attended for physical therapy and chiropractic care without relief.  He is able to get 
restorative sleep.  The physical examination findings today are substantially similar 
to the findings when I saw him in February.
Mr. Smith experiencing neurogenic claudication from the advance spinal stenosis 
as noted above.  At this time, given the failure to respond to conservative care and 
MRI findings, I am referring him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  
He should be continuing with flexion-based exercises and activity to tolerance.

136,75,"I initially saw Ms. Smith February 11, 2022 and she was reporting left more than 
right leg pain.  The left pain is characterized as a burning and sharp pain with 
numbness about the left ankle and foot.  Most of her pain is in the left buttock and 
posterior upper thigh. Physical therapy had not helped.
The clinical presentation was commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  There is 
no significant motor weakness.  X-rays of the lumbar spine revealed degenerative 
changes at the upper and lower lumbar spine. I requisitioned a lumbar MRI.
Ms. Smith reports today that her symptoms remain unchanged.  She has limited 
walking tolerance to about 1/2 block.  The lumbar MRI was performed March 2, 
2022 and reveals a left L4-5 paracentral disc herniation with impingement of the left 
L5 nerve root.
In view of the ongoing leg dominant pain, the failure to respond to conservative care, 
diminished functioning, and examination along with MRI findings, I am referring Ms. 
Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  She should be continuing

Pain produced with Flexion
N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back, left buttock and leg pain.  The 
leg pain is characterized as sharp in sensation, and there is paresthesia in his toes.  
He has a history of chronic lower back pain, and the left leg pain has been present 
for a few years.  He has been prescribed exercises which have little affect.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left S1 radiculopathy.  Mr. 
Smith has mechanical/discogenic lower back pain.  Lumbar MRI performed July 
23, 2021 reveals left L5-S1 disc herniation.
In view of the persisting left leg pain and the impact on his quality of life (he has not 
been able to work), I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. D. Guha.  For his back pain he could trial a course of spinal 
mobilization/manipulation with a chiropractor or manipulatively trained physical 
therapist.  A reasonable trial of treatment would be 10 sessions over a month or so.  
If his back pain remains disabling despite treatment, then consideration should be 
given to referring him to a pain clinic for possible facet joint injections or medial 
branch blocks.  He is encourage to continue with self-directed exercises.

138,77,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left sided lower back pain.  The pain 
is chronic and not improving. She has limited walking and standing tolerance.  She 
has found some relief with chiropractic care and acupuncture, but nothing lasting.  
She is performing self-directed exercises.  Her health in general is otherwise 
non-contributory.
The physical examination suggests that her pain is mechanical and related to 
degenerative changes.  It may be facetogenic and possibly related to costo-vertebral 
irritation.  There are subtle signs of left S1 radiculopathy as well and this is related 
to spinal canal stenosis at L5-S1.
Given her lower back pain, it is not clear that Ms. Smith is a good surgical 
candidate.  Nevertheless, in view of the unremitting back pain, functional limitations 
and the affect on her quality of life, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  There is no contraindication to gentle manual 
therapy/mobilization.  I have also referred her to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for 
facet/medial branch blocks to see if this may proffer her some relief.  She is 
encouraged to continue with self-directed exercises.

standing and walking tolerance, with relief with sitting down.  She has been seeing 
her chiropractor who has also prescribed exercises.  Treatment seems to help a 
little.  Other than hypertension, her health in general is good.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There are no signs of radiculopathy, myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy.  The 
lumbar MRI was performed December 6, 2021 and reveals severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1.
Her clinical presentation is consistent with neurogenic claudication, with related 
restrictions in walking and standing.  Given her age, but considering her otherwise 
good health, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged her to continue with self-directed exercises and

143,86,"I initially saw Ms. Smith on February 15, 2022.  She was reporting lower back and 
right leg pain which began after a fall in 2015 at which time she also fractured her 
pelvis.  She characterizes the leg pain as sharp and shooting pain.  She has tried 
physical therapy without relief.  She is performing home-based exercises.  She has 
limited walking tolerance of only about 3 blocks before she has to sit down.  Based 
on her clinical presentation and my examination, it was my opinion that Ms. Smith 
was experiencing unilateral neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar MRI was required.
The MRI was performed at GNMI on February 28, 2022.  There is moderate spinal 
canal stenosis at L2-3.  There is severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and Grade II 
spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.

144,88,"I saw Mr. Smith for consultation February 15, 2022.  He was reporting lower back 
and leg pain, characterized as a burning and paresthesia.  He can experience sharp 
pain in the right leg at times.  He has limited walking and standing tolerance.  He had 
tried physical therapy without relief and had attended at a pain clinic.  He was 
continuing with self-directed, home based exercises.  His medical history includes 
essential hypertension, diabetes, Smith's esophagus, anxiety, and COPD.  Mr. 
Smith had left femoral artery stent surgery which was helpful for some of the left 
leg pain.
The clinical presentation was commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  I 
requisitioned a lumbar MRI and was to follow-up with Mr. Smith post-MRI.
The MRI was performed April 28, 2022 and reveals a cardinal finding of severe 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is 
moderate canal stenosis at L4-5.
At this time Mr. Smith reports that his pain and functional limitations remain the

a few beats of clonus on left.  Hyperreflexic upper limbs.
Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and right leg pain.  The onset was 
in September 2021 and pain is worsening.  She characterizes the left pain as sharp 
and traveling to the ankle.  She has had physical therapy, acupuncture and massage 
without relief.  Her sleep is disrupted due to pain.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is corresponding finding on MRI of moderate to severe right IFV stenosis at 
L5-S1 and also a disc protrusion with contact of the S1 nerve root.
Given the worsening leg dominant pain, lack of response to conservative care, the 
examination and MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith.  Ms. Smith should be continuing with self-directed exercises.  The 
physical examination reveals long tract signs (positive Hoffman's sign, Smith,

146,90,"Mr. Smith presents with leg more than lower back pain.  He describes constant 
right lateral leg pain (burning) which began about 5 years ago.  He reports a 
cramping and lancinating pain at the posterior left thigh.  He has cramping in his 
calves.  He does not report his lower back pain to be a significant issue.  He had 
chiropractic care at first, but there was no lasting relief.  He has been receiving 
epidural injections every three months, with variable levels of relief.  He says that his 
sleep is not disrupted.  His health in general is good.  His standing tolerance is less 
than 5 minutes due to his symptoms.
The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith to be neurologically intact, other than 
mild weakness of the right EHL.  There is some nerve root tension on the right with 
slump testing.  Advanced imaging has not been performed, but plain films of the 
lumbar spine performed in 2018 reveal disc space loss at L5-S1.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5 
radiculopathy.  There may be L5 root irritation to account for the left leg pain.  Given 
the ongoing leg dominant pain and impact on his quality of life, I have requisitioned a 
lumbar MRI and will be following up with him after the MRI.  In the interim, he 
should be continuing with self-directed exercises and could pursue a course of 
manual treatment with a chiropractor or manually trained physical therapist for 
lower back pain.

No pain produced with either flexion or extension
N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of burning and numbness about the left 
anterior thigh and knee.  The onset was in November 2021.  He has had intermittent 
weakness.  He has found chiropractic manual manipulation has helped with lower 
back pain and improving mobility.  The pain has improved quite a bit with 
medication.  He is doing exercises daily.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is no nerve root tension with supine straight leg raising or with femoral nerve 
stretch.  There is no significant motor deficit other than very mild weakness of the 
left quadriceps.  
Mr. Smith says that he is scheduled for a lumbar MRI March 5, 2022.  I suspect that 
there may be a disc protrusion at L2-3 or L3-4.  I have recommended to him that I

(modalities) in the remote past have helped for acute flare-ups.  She finds that 
exercises can provide her with a little relief.  Her health in general is good.  She 
continues working as a Lab Technician.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  Her 
pain distribution is consistent with S1 dermatomal distribution, and MRI of the

relief, and intramuscular injections have not helped significantly.  Her medical history 
is otherwise unremarkable other than hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She had 
scoliosis as a child and had Harrington Rods which were removed.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with mechanical lower back 
pain.  She has had a couple of bouts of left foot drop, but there is no significant 
weakness of the lower limbs identified today.  The pain into the hips and thighs may 
at least in part be scleratogenous type pain from the lumbo-sacral area.  Her hip 
ranges of motion were good, and there is nothing to suggest any abnormality or 
internal derangement of the hips proper.  A lumbar MRI was performed September

5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion 
are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed September 28, 2021.  There is a broad based disc 
herniation at L4-5.  There is severe canal and moderate foraminal stenosis.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms consistent with neurogenic claudication.  Given the 
ongoing pain and impact on his functioning, I am referring him for a spine surgical 
consultation.  I am referring him to Dr. Smith.  For his back pain he could trial side 
posture spinal mobilization/manipulation.  A reasonable trial would be 10 sessions 
over a month.  If he is not responsive, then consideration could be given to referring 
him to a pain clinic for facet joint/medial branch blocks.  He should be continuing 
with self-directed exercises.

160,531,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right more than left leg pain.  The onset 
was in November 2021, although he has had a prior episode which resolved.  He 
characterizes the pain as sharp and which travels as distal as the lateral ankle.  He 
does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal 
numbness.  Exercises have not provided relief.  His medical history includes essential 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and benign fasculation syndrome.  Mr. Smith had 
lumbar surgery (L4-5 fusion) in 2003, and he had a cardiac stent implanted in 2016.
The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith to be neurologically intact.  Reflexes 
are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 
bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is reduced to sharp 
testing along the right L4 and S1 dermatomes.  Straight leg raising caused right 
buttock pain.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and non-provocative.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  A lumbar MRI 
was performed in March 2019 and this reveals significant spinal canal stenosis at 
L3-4 and L4-5, and moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L3-4.
Mr. Smith presents with right leg radicular symptoms, likely related to the stenotic 
changes at L3-4.  If the leg pain persists he will likely require a spine surgical 
opinion.  He is scheduled for a lumbar MRI August 31, 2022 and I will be following up 
with him afterwards.  In the interim, he should continue with self-directed exercises.

161,536,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left leg more than lower back pain.  
The pain is in the left leg to the calf, and characterized as an ache and throb.  There 
is an increase in pain with walking (limited to less than 1 block) and standing (less 
than 5 minutes), and relief with lying down.  Exercises are not helpful.  Mr. 
Smith says that pain is worsening and his functioning has deteriorated.  He 
has tried physical therapy, acupuncture, massage and chiropractic care without 
significant relief.  Tens and exercises are not helping.  Medications include 
Gabapentin and Acetaminophen.  The only other medication he is taking is a statin.  
His health in general is good other than dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
There is weakness of the left EHL 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished in the left L5 
dermatome at the autonomous zone between the first and second digits.  There is 
no nerve root tension with straight leg raising.  Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 1+ 
and 2+ at the Achilles.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  Power 
is 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except the left EHL which is 4+/5.  Supine straight leg 
raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI was performed April 24, 2022.  On personal review of the images 
there is facet hypertrophy at L4-5 on the left with lateral recess stenosis and 
compression of the left L5 nerve root.
In view of the worsening left leg pain and lack of response to conservative 
measures, as well as his significant functional decline, I am referring Mr. 
Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also referred 
him for an epidural injection to see if this may proffer him some relief pending 
surgical consultation.

163,540,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of lower back pain.  She has had back 
pain since the age of 17 when she fell, but experienced an acute flare up of pain in 
April 2022 when she felt intense pain through her lower thoracic area spreading into 
the flanks.  She does not have any lower extremity pain, but does sometimes feel an 
ache through the right anterior thigh.  She has some paresthesia in the left great 
toe.  She has OA of the left knee, but her health is otherwise good.  She does not 
smoke.  She is not taking any pain relieving medication.  The only medication she is 
taking is estrogel.

reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 
bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  She could heel and toe walk 
without difficulty and Smith test is unremarkable.  Vibration and position sense is 
preserved in the lower and upper limbs.  There is no clonus or spasticity, or other 
pyramidal signs.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is tenderness 
to segmental challenge in the lower lumbar spine.
A thoracic MRI was performed May 31, 2022.  There is a large disc protrusion at 
T10-11 with mass affect on the thecal sac and cord.  Xrays of the lumbar spine 
reveal degenerative disc disease at L5-S1 and L3-4.
Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back pain.  She has a thoracic disc herniation at 
T10-11 with mass affect on the cord.  The age of the herniation is unknown.  While 
she is neurologically normal on physical examination, the disc herniation will require 
monitoring.  I have requisitioned a CT scan to evaluate for any calcification and have 
referred her to Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  For her back pain, since 
she has not responded to chiropractic care, I have referred Ms. Smith to a pain 
clinic for medial branch/facet joint blocks.  She should be continuing with 
self-directed exercises.

I anterolisthesis at L4-5.  There is some canal stenosis at L3-4.
Ms. Smith presents with fairly classic symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  She will 
require a surgical consultation given her functional decline, but an updated MRI is 
required first.  This will reveal if there is any progression of the canal stenosis at 
L3-4. Standing xrays of the lumbar spine were performed today for pre-surgical 
planning.  I have requisitioned an MRI here at HGH as I work under medical 
directives.  However, given wait times at HGH, consideration could also be given to 
requisition of MRI elsewhere (perhaps GNMI) for a more expedited procedure, but 
requisition is deferred to her physician.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
flexion-based exercises.  I will be following up with her after the updated MRI.

pain being 90% of her difficulties.  There is associated numbness in the right leg.  
She has a history of chronic lower back pain, but he leg symptoms have been 
present for several years.  The pain is worsening.  She has attended for osteopathic 
treatment which helps, and physical therapy has provided some relief.  She has also 
attended for injections which provides some relief.  She relates more recent onset of 
neck and right shoulder pain related to stress from financial concerns.  Ms. Smith's 
health in general is otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker.  She works as a 
Bookkeeper, but is having difficulty completing her work due to inability to sit for long 
periods.
The physical examination reveals her to be essentially neurologically intact.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  There is 
some weakness/fatiguability of the right calf to repeat single leg calf raises.  There is 
a positive straight leg raise on the right.  There is tenderness at the right L5-S1 level 
and at the sacroiliac joint.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and 
non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed November 20, 2021.  The cardinal findings are 
degenerative disc changes at L4-5 and L5-S1.  There is a right L5-S1 disc protrusion 
and impingement/mass affect on the right S1 nerve root.  There are modic changes 
at L4-5.
Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with right S1 nerve root 
irritation/radiculopathy.  She also has mechanical lower back pain related to 
degenerative disc and facet joint changes in the lower lumbar spine.  Given her 
limited response to conservative measures, at this time I am referring her for a 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to 
continue with self-directed exercises.  I query whether a neuromodulator such as 
Gabapentin would provide relief, as well as a sleep aid, perhaps Smith.  I 
defer further consideration to her physician.  There is no need for follow-up with 
myself and her surgical candidacy is deferred to Dr. Smith.

179,577,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right more than left leg pain.  He has 
limited walking tolerance and reports diminished balance and he has fallen.  He 
reports a  burning sensation at the front of his thighs and feet, with occasional 
lancinating pain.  He experiences spasms in his calves.  There is an increase in pain 
with sitting, standing and walking.  He is performing stretches and has found cold 
packs helpful.  Mr. Smith is attending at a pain clinic weekly for injections.  Mr. 
Smith is also reporting occasional tingling in his hands.  He has balance issues 
and uses a cane from time to time.  He is taking Lyrical 125 mg per day, and Tylenol 
xtra strength prn.  His health is reported to be otherwise good.  He does have a 
venous disorder of the left lower leg, possibly related to prior major trauma 
requiring ORIF.  He works in Customer Service but has not been able to return to 
work since January 24, 2022.
The physical examination findings are concerning for myelopathy.  Patellar reflexes 
are hyperreflexic and pathologic.  Upper limb reflexes are hyperreflexic.  There is 
positive Hoffman's sign bilaterally.  There is positive Smith and upgoing great toes 
bilaterally.  Power is 5/5 except for the right EHL and FHL.  Supine straight leg 
raising is non provocative.  Vibration sense (128 hz tuning fork) is diminished in the 
right foot.  Upper limb reflexes are 3+.  The pectoral reflexes are hyperreflexic.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Mr. Smith is unable to tandem walk 
and there is positive sharpened Smith test.
There are signs of myelopathy and concern regarding cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy.  Mr. Smith is in the right age category and there are clear long tract 
signs.  An cervical spine lesion would likely be cephalad to C4 given the hyperreflexic 
pectoral reflexes.  He also may have unilateral neurogenic claudication and there are 
signs of right L5 radiculopathy, but his lumbar spine is of secondary concern at this 
time.  He will require a spine surgical consultation, but MRI imaging of his cervical 
spine is required first.  I have referred him to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon, in order 
not to delay the process and have requisitioned a cervical spine MRI.  Mr. Smith 
says that an updated lumbar MRI has already also been ordered.  I have 
recommended to Mr. Smith that he speak to his physician about getting the 
cervical spine elsewhere than HGH.  I work under medical directives and can only 
order it here at HGH where wait times can be long.  A much quicker alternative 
would be GNMI, but I defer the completion of the requisition to his primary care 
physician.  I told Mr. Smith to call me when the cervical MRI is complete and I 
can go over the findings with him.

180,579,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The onset was 
in December 2021.  He feels that he is improving, however is not certain if this is 
related to medication that he is taking.  About a week ago he forgot to take his pain 
medication (Cymbalta 60 OD) for a day and pain intensely recurred.  He reports 
having occasional tingling sensation on the lateral of the left foot.  Mr. Smith tried 
physical therapy and massage without relief.  He works seasonally as a Chef, is 
currently working, and reports that standing is not too troublesome.  He is limited in 
walking and sitting for about 5 to 10 minutes.  Mr. Smith has essential 
hypertension and smokes about 3/4 pack of cigarettes per day.  He has undergone 
prior L4-5 discectomy in 2011 and total left hip replacement in 2013. He is not 
performing any specific back exercises, but is walking and remaining active.
Other medications include: Amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and rosuvastatin
The physical examination reveals his gait and cadence to be normal.  There is an 
increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  Mr. Smith could heel and toe walk without 
difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+, except for the left Achilles which is 1+.  
Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  
Power is graded 5/5 and there is no weakness with single leg calf raises.  There is a 
positive straight leg raise and slump test on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed at St. Joseph's hospital on April 13, 2022.  The 
cardinal finding is a left paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1 with caudal migration of 
disc material.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of left S1 radiculopathy.  At this time, given his 
lack of response to conservative care, examination and MRI findings, and leg 
dominance to his pain, I am referring his for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He should continue with his activities and exercises.

181,580,"The physical examination reveals that Mr. Smith is neurologically intact.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is 
graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits, except 
for the left hip and reduced internal rotation.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent and there are no long tract signs such as clonus or spasticity.  Plantar 
responses are downgoing.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 7, 2022.  There is significant epidural 
lipomatosis at L3-4 and L4-5 with near complete effacement of the thecal sac.  
There is a small disc protrusion at L3-4.
Mr. Smith presents with fairly classic symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  There 
is marked spinal canal stenosis from epidural lipomatosis.  As a result of his 
symptoms and functional limitations Mr. Smith has gained weight.  I have strongly 
encouraged weight loss as this may also help with the epidural lipomatosis.  Given 
his ongoing functional difficulties, I am also referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that he consider 
stationary bicycling as he may be able to tolerate this better than walking for 
cardiovascular conditioning and to help with weight loss.

182,581,"Ms. Checkley-Fearman presents with a complaint of lower back and left more than 
right leg pain.  She has a history of chronic lower back pain, and leg pains have been 
present for several years.  Her symptoms are worsening.  She relates limited 
walking tolerance of only about 5 to 10 minutes.  Exercises help a little.  She 
underwent a course of physical therapy a couple of years ago, but treatment only 
provided her with relief for a few hours.  She has been undergoing epidural 
injections every few months, and this helps for a few days.  Ms. Checkley-Fearman 
is able to void her bladder, but reports some perineal numbness.  Her medical 
history includes a history of breast cancer twice, and kidney cancer.  She has had a 
collapsed lung.  She is a non-smoker.  She is osteoporotic.
Medications include: Tylenol 3 prn, Tylenol xtra strength - 3 or 4 per week, and she 
also uses a multiprofen cream.  The only other medication she takes is risendronate.
The physical examination reveals normal gait.  She was not using any supports.  
There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+, except for the left Achilles reflex which is 1+.  Power is graded 5/5 
except for the EHL's bilaterally at 4+/5.  Sensation to sharp testing is reduced in the 
feet but in a non-dermatomal pattern.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits in a seated position.  Ms. 
Checkley-Fearman could not lie in a supine position, but slump testing did cause leg 
pain/nerve root tension bilaterally.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 10, 2022.  There is a Grade II/III L5-S1 
spondylolisthesis.  There is severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally.
Ms. Checkley-Fearman has signs and symptoms of bilateral L5 radiculopathy, and left 
S1 radiculopathy.  She has chronic back pain related to the significant 
spondylolisthesis.  In view of the worsening symptoms and lack of significant 
improvement with more conservative measures, including epidural injections, as well 
as the impact on her quality of life, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am 
referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She should continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

183,582,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock and leg pain, and as distal 
as the foot.  She describes some weakness of the right foot and slight foot drop.  
The symptoms began insidiously about 2 years ago and she has not experienced any 
significant improvement.  She has been prescribed flexion based exercises, but these 
are not providing significant relief.  Her functioning is affected.  She used to go for 
long walks, but now her walking and standing tolerance is limited to 10 to 20 
minutes.  Her health is otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker.  She works as a 
Social Worker and is continuing to work.
On physical examination her gait and cadence was normal.  She was not using any 
supports.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  
There is mild weakness of the right EHL 4+/5, and weakness to repeat single calf 
raise on the right, but otherwise power L2 to S1 is 5/5.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman sign is absent bilaterally.  
There is a positive slump and supine straight leg raise on the right.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 9, 2022.  The cardinal finding is a Grade I 
spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 with right subarticular recess stenosis, and severe right 
foraminal stenosis.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5/S1 radiculopathy.  There are 
corresponding findings on MRI.  Given her ongoing leg dominant pain, functional 
limitations and decreased quality of life, as well as imaging findings, I am referring

184,584,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left buttock and leg pain, traveling 
as acral as the great toe.  She had some back pain post partum in September 2021, 
and then developed left pain in January 2022.  Pain is worsening.  She has weakness 
of the left foot which is worsening and she has a foot drop.  She describes the leg 
pain as lancinating, and there is paresthesia (burning, pins, needles sensation) into 
the dorsum of the left foot.  She has not had any significant relief with physical 
therapy or acupuncture.  There is no change to bowel or bladder functioning, and no 
perineal numbness.  Pain can disturb her sleep.  Medications include: Pregabalin 150 
mg tid, Naproxen 500 mg bid, Dilaudid 2 mg bid, Tylenol 1000 mg tid.  Ms. Smith 
reports that her health is otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker.

Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+.  Power is graded 5/5 except for profound weakness 
of the left EHL 1+/5, and to resisted foot dorsiflexion 3+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved to sharp sensation in all dermatomes.  There is 
nerve root tension with left straight leg raising and slump testing.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 29, 2022 at HGH.  The cardinal finding is a left 
L4-5 disc herniation with caudal migration.  There is marked left lateral recess 
stenosis.  There is disc dessication at L4-5 and L5-S1.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a left L5 radiculopathy.  I am 
concerned about progressive weakness and left foot drop.  In view of the chronicity 
of symptoms, examination findings, impact on her quality of life and weakness, and 
MRI findings, I am referring her for spine surgical consultation.  I asked that this be

185,587,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  She describes a 
heaviness and ache in the legs, and reports that her walking tolerance is only a 
couple of hundred meters.  She is also experiencing pain in her back and legs at 
nighttime.  She is limited with her ability to any chores at home.  She does find relief 
with stretching exercises, and has been able to walk on a treadmill.  Ms. Smith 
attended at a couple of pain clinics for injections (intramuscular and image guided) 
without relief.  Her medical history includes diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and OA 
of the great toes which required fusion.  She says that she does have a history of 
mild diabetic neuropathy.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day.  
Medications include: Pain: Advil xtra strength 2 per day. Other: rabeprazole, 
risendronate, candesartan, metformin, alpraz, ozempic, rosuvastatin, 
hydrochlorothiazide.
Ms. Smith presents using a wheeled walker.  She has very limited walking 
tolerance.  She could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 
1+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
Power is grade 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  There is negative straight leg raising with no 
nerve root tension.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally and there are no long 
tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed June 21, 2022.  The cardinal finding is severe spinal 
canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is 
obliteration of CSF signal.  There is some foraminal stenosis bilaterally.  There is 
facet arthropathy in the lower lumbar spine and a Grade I degenerative 
anterolisthesis of L4 on L5.
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms that are fairly typical for neurogenic 
claudication.  Her quality of life is significantly impacted and she has been using a 
walker for about 6 months.  Given this, and in consideration of imaging findings, I am 
referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith and asked that the 
consultation be expedited.   I have encouraged her to continue with self-directed 
exercises and activity to tolerance.

Xrays of the lumbar spine and pelvis were performed June 6, 2022.  There is mild to 
moderate OA of the right hip, and mild on the left.  There are advanced 
degenerative changes of the lumbar spine.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  He likely has 
advanced spinal canal stenosis of the lower lumbar spine.  Advanced imaging is 
required, but he is precluded from having an MRI due to his pacemaker.  He says he 
is scheduled for a CT scan of his lumbar spine next week.  I have recommended to 
Mr. Smith that I follow-up with him after the CT scan.  I anticipate that he will 
require a surgical consultation, but given his health history he is not the best of 
surgical candidates.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with self-directed 
exercises.  He can continue with the chiropractic care if it provides relief.

187,590,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right sided lower back and thigh pain.  
The onset was in November 2021.  The pain in the right thigh is described as a 
burning sensation, and lower back is an ache.  He relates that she has bladder 
retention and has to exert herself to void her bladder and bowel.  There is no saddle 
anesthesia.  She attended a pain clinic for injections without relief.  Physical therapy 
was not helpful.   She is able to get restful sleep.  Her medical history includes a 
history of seizures and migraine headaches.  She has essential hypertension.
On physical examination she presented in the accompaniment of her son.  She was 
using a walker.  She is significantly antalgic to the left.  Due to her mobility issues no 
supine testing was performed.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished 
along the right L3 dermatome.  Seated straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip 
external and internal rotation bilaterally was within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed April 21, 2022.  The images are substantially similar to 
prior study.  There is a right subarticular disc herniation at L1-2 and moderate canal 
stenosis.  There is moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis at L2-3.
Ms. Smith presents with right L2-3 radicular symptoms and there are structural spine 
changes that are causing her antalgia.  There is a degenerative listhesis of her 
spine.  Due to concern for possible vertebral collapse, I requisitioned standing plain 
films of the lumbar spine today and these do not reveal any further collapse.  There 
is demineralization.  There is a Grade I retrolisthesis of L2 on L3.  L2-3 and L4-5 disc 
spaces ae not well assessed due to spine orientation and demineralization.
Ms. Smith was in hospital in April and saw a resident for Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon.  
It was not felt that she had cauda equine syndrome and it was recommended that 
Ms. Smith follow-up with Dr. Guha in his outpatient clinic.  I agree with this 
recommendation, and while her age and bone quality would count against her being 
a likely surgical candidate, the consultation is nevertheless very reasonable.  I have 
encouraged her to perform activities to tolerance and she can apply hot or cold 
compresses if she finds relief.  She should continue to use the walker to minimize 
the chance for a fall.  Neurologically, I did not find any significant deficit.  I have also 
referred her to the DeGroote Pain Clinic for consideration of her candidacy for an 
epidural injection.

188,591,"Ms. Smith presents with complaints of left more than right leg pain.  Most of her 
pain is left buttock and leg.  She has had several episodes, but this episode has 
lasted about 18 months and pain is worsening.  She has attended at ER on several 
occasions.  She has tried chiropractic care and physical therapy without relief.  Ms. 
Smith reports that her sleep is disrupted due to pain.  She has paresthesia in the 
left foot.  She works with disabled children and has significant difficulty completing 
her work.  She also had a job working in an office, but had to quit this job.  Other 
than a history of digestive problems, Ms. Smith says that her health is otherwise 
good.  She recently quit smoking.  She does not report any allergies.
Medications are limited to Smith 10 mg prn, not daily, and Tylenol 3 prn.
The physical examination reveals a young woman in obvious physical distress.  She 
was antalgic to the right.  She was using a cane.  There is an increase in pain with 
lumbar flexion.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ bilaterally at the patellae and Achilles.  
Power is graded 5/5 except for the left EHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved to sharp and light touch in all dermatomes.  
There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits and pain free.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
and there are no pyramidal/long tract signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed June 29, 2022.  There is a disc herniation at L4-5, 
more prominent to the left and significant left lateral recess stenosis.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of left L5 radiculopathy.  Given the 
ongoing and worsening left leg dominant pain, the impact on her quality of life, the 
lack of response to conservative measures, along with examination and MRI findings,

189,601,"Ms. Smith presents today in the accompaniment of her son.  She presents in a 
wheelchair and has limited walking ability.  She reports left thigh and leg pain, but 
on further inquiry she relates that it's more of a spasm.  She describes sharp pain in 
the left buttock.  She has had a few falls, and feels that the first one about 5 months 
ago triggered all her symptoms.  However, on further inquiry she indicates that she 
had leg pain before that.  Her worst pain is first thing in the mornings.  She has 
some bladder and bowel incontinence and describes perineal numbness.  Her health 
is otherwise good.  Ms. Smith has had 2 lumbar surgeries in 2008 and again in 
2019.  She says that the first surgery helped, but not the second.  She has extensive 
hardware in her lumbar spine.
Medications: Duloxetine 60 mg OD, Baclofen 10 mg tid, Nitrazepam 5 mg x 2 qhs, 
Arthrotec 75 mg/200 mcg bid, Tylenol 2 prn.
The physical examination today was abridged and done only with Ms. Smith seated 
due to mobility issues.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Muscle bulk and tone is symmetrical.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Supine straight leg raising is 
non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes 
are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
Lumbosacral and pelvic xrays taken February 10, 2022 do not reveal any signs of 
bony injury.  A CT scan of the lumbar spine performed July 17, 2022 reveals severe 
degenerative changes.  The spinal canal and foramen of the lumbar spine are not 
well assessed due to artifact from the metal.  There is lucency (3 mm) around the L1 
pedicle screw suspicious for loosening.
Ms. Smith is status post lumbar spine surgeries and has ongoing pain and spasming 
of the left leg.  Neurological screen today does not reveal any significant deficit.  For 
further evaluation of the L1 pedicle screw I have referred Ms. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also referred her to the Smith 
Pain Clinic to see if there may be an intervention, perhaps epidural, which would 
help with the left leg pain.  She should be performing activities to tolerance and 
continue with exercises.

190,602,"Ms. Smith was walking with the aid of a cane in her left hand.  There is an anterior 
list of the torso.  Increased lower back pain was reported with attempted lumbar 
extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+.  Power is diffusely 4/5 in the lower limbs 
with no myotomal weakness L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and non-provocative.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There are no long 
tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed June 16, 2022.  There is multilevel degenerative disc 
changes.  There is spondylotic spondylolisthesis at L4-5.  At the same level there is 
moderate canal and severe right recess and foraminal stenosis.  There are advanced 
degenerative facet changes in the lower lumbar spine.  A lumbar CT scan was 
performed August 3, 2022 reveals degenerative changes.
Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back pain due to degenerative changes and 
spondylotic spondylolisthesis.  She has some neurogenic claudication, but estimates 
that more than 80% of her difficulties are related to the lower back pain.  She has 
had treatment/injections at a pain clinic, and does not wish to pursue further 
treatment in a pain clinic.  She believes that a lumbar fusion is the answer to her 
difficulties.  Given the imaging changes and significant functional limitations, as well 
as failure to respond to more conservative measures, I am referring Ms. Smith for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Ms. Smith should continue with 
activity to tolerance.

191,605,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock pain.  He uses to have leg 
pain to the foot but this has improved.  In June he had his right knee replaced and 
has just begun a course of rehabilitation.  He therefore is not certain if any residual 
pain in the right leg is related to his knee.  He is walking more and doing home 
based exercises.  Mr. Smith has had physical therapy in the past, and injections 
were helpful.  He is taking hydromorphone and other medications for pain relief, but 
cannot recall the names.  He is taking an statin and medication for anxiety, the name 
of which he could not recall.  He is a non smoker.  He cannot do chores at home.  He 
was working as a Forklift Operator, but is recovering from his knee surgery.
The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith is neurologically intact.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+.  Sensation is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Power is 
graded 5/5 except for some pain apprehension related to his right knee.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+, except triceps which are 3+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI performed September 16, 2021 reveals disc bulging at the right IVF at 
L4-5.  There is abutment of the right L5 nerve root.  There is significant right 
foraminal stenosis.
Mr. Smith is status post right knee replacement and had recently begun rehab.  It is 
possible that he has right L4 nerve root irritation that is causing right buttock pain.  
The pain is no longer lancinating into the lower leg.  I have recommended to Mr. 
Smith that he complete his rehab for the right knee and if the right leg pain recurs 
he could follow-up with me.  He should consider a course of physical therapy for the 
ongoing right buttock pain which may be related to right L4 nerve root irritation.

claudication, although she is also experiencing symptoms in the right leg.  Her 
functioning has declined and she has not responded to conservative therapy.  Given 
this and the MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith.  In preparation for the surgical consultation, standing xrays of the 
lumbar spine were performed today.  Consideration could be given to referring Ms.

193,609,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain to the foot. Pain has been 
present for years but is worsening.  There is numbness around the ankle and into 
the great toe.  There is cramping.  Ms. Smith has incontinence for which she 
sees a urologist.  There is no urinary retention, and there is no perineal anesthesia 
or saddle numbness.  Mr. Smith has attended for physical therapy and 
chiropractic care without relief.  She does attend for depomedrol injections, and 
these seem to provide her with relief.    The only medication she takes for pain is 
Baclofen.  
Ms. Smith's medical history reveals that in 2010 she had L4-5 laminectomy/canal 
enlargement which helped with right leg pain.  She has a history of migraine 
headaches, and had a blood clot in the left arm.  She is a non-smoker.  Other 
medications include: imitrex, myrbetrix, symbicort, eliquis, raloxifine, fluoxetine, 
ducosate, topiramate, solifenacin, and lansoprazole.  
The physical examination reveals a normal gait and Ms. Smith was not using any 
supports.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar extension.  She could heel and 
toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Power is 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the right quadriceps.  
Resisted right foot dorsiflexion was 4+/5.  Right EHL is 4/5.  Sensation is diminished 
along the right L5 and S1 dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal 
limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  Supine 
straight leg raising is positive on the right.  
A lumbar MRI was performed at HGH on June 24, 2022.  There is a Grade II 
anterolisthesis L4 on L5.  There is severe right foraminal stenosis.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L4/5 radiculopathy.  The leg dominant 
pain is worsening and significantly impacting on her quality of life. She reports a 
standing and walking tolerance of only about 5 to 10 minutes.  Given this and the 
MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  I have encouraged her to continue with 
self-directed exercises.  She finds some relief with the injections, and may wish to 
continue with these.

194,615,"Mr. Smith has a history of chronic lower back pain.  He developed left leg pain in 
February 2022 and in June he underwent a discectomy at L4-5.  An MRI performed 
March 10, 2022 confirmed a left L4-5 disc herniation..  He says that he felt better for 
several weeks after the surgery, but then the leg pain recurred.  He saw his 
surgeon, Dr. Smith, yesterday and a new MRI has been requisitioned.  
Mr. Smith's medical history is unremarkable other than GERD and headaches.  
Medications include Lyrica 150 mg bid, Hydromorphone prn, Celebrex and Flexeril.  
He is also taking Smith and Domperidone.
The physical examination findings today reveal muscle stretch reflexes to be 2+ at 
the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 and S1 
dermatomes.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  There is no significant strength 
deficit with testing of all myotomes.  Straight leg raising did not cause any leg pain, 
but did cause lower back pain.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and 
pain free.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
Mr. Smith has signs of left L5 radiculopathy.  He may have re-herniated the L4-5 
disc.  Dr. Smith has requisitioned a new MRI and I have recommended to Mr. Smith 
that he see Dr. Smith after the MRI.   For Mr. Smith's back pain I have referred him 
to a pain clinic for consideration of interventions such as medial branch/facet joint 
block.

197,624,"Ms. Smith presents today with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  There is 
numbness in her calves and pain in the ankles.  She has had prior episodes of back 
pain, but feels that her leg pain has only been present since surgery for necrotizing 
fasciitis.  She relates having bladder problems due to muscle damage, but she is 
able to void.  There is no report of any perineal numbness.  Ms. Smith says that 
she has fallen a few times.  He has had massage and intramuscular injections 
without significant relief.  She has limited walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes 
due to leg pain and weakness.  She says that she has fallen on a few occasions.  Ms. 
Smith is not gainfully employed and last worked in 2020 as a caregiver.
The medical history includes necrotizing fasciitis affecting her buttock in 2020 which 
required tissue removal.  She has an ileostomy bag.  She has IDDM, essential 
hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day.  
She is allergies to some antibiotics and latex.

198,631,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left leg pain.  He 
describes a burning and numbness.  Symptoms are chronic and he relates to me 
that he has had falls every few days with the left leg giving way.  There is no change 
to bowel or bladder functioning and no perineal numbness.  There is reported 
significant left leg weakness and difficulty performing exercises.  He has noticed 
diminished muscle mass of the left leg.  He has lower back pain at nighttime.  Mr. 
Rittenhouse says that he is scheduled to have CT and EMG investigations performed.
Review of his health history reveals that he has had prior lower back surgeries, three 
in total, including a fusion in the 1990s.  His health is otherwise good.  Mr. 
Rittenhouse is a non-smoker.  He has had his left ACL repaired.  He is retired and 
reports having difficulty completing chores at home.
Medications include: Baclofen, Nabilone, Pregabalin, Smith, and 
Methylprednisone injections.
Mr. Smith stands 5'11"" and weighs 205 lbs.  He walks with a limp favouring his 
left leg.  He uses a cane.  There is atrophy of the left quadriceps.  There is an 
increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+. 
Plantar responses are silent.  Power is 3+/5 of resisted left knee extension, 4+/5 of 
left knee flexion, 2+/5 of left ankle dorsiflexion and 1+/5 of the left EHL.  There is 
tenderness at the left Smith and there is a positive thigh thrust on the left.  Straight 
leg raising caused an increase in lower back pain, but not leg pain.  Femoral nerve 
stretch test was negative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There is no spasticity or 
clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 14, 2022.  From L3 to S1 images are 
non-diagnostic due to hardare artifact.  There is moderate canal stenosis at L2-3.
The physical examination is suggestive of left L3-4 radiculopathy and there appears 
to be left sacroiliac joint irritation.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that I 
follow-up with him after the CT and EMG studies.  In the interim, he could try some 
manual mobilization/manipulation to his sacroiliac joints with a physical therapist or 
chiropractor.  I have also referred him to a pain clinic for consideration of medial 
branch/facet joint blocks.

199,634,"Ms. Smith has had prior spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith in 2018.  At that 
time she was managing reasonably well.  Dr. Smith stated that if her symptoms 
progressed that an updated MRI would be in order and likely she would be a surgical 
candidate.
Ms. Smith is not taking any pain relieving medications.  She is taking 
pantoprazole, olmesartan 40 mg and crestor.  She has a history of chronic back 
pain.  She has essential hypertension, but her health is otherwise good.  She does 
not smoke.  Prior surgeries include right ulnar nerve transposition, and stripping of 
right varicose veins.
The physical examination reveals that Ms. Smith walks with a normal, reciprocal 
gait and she was not using any supports.  She stands 5'2"" and weighs 169 lbs.  
Active lumbar spine ranges of motion were non-provocative.  She could heel and toe 
walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles 
bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Supine straight leg raising was positive on the left, along with slump 
testing.  There  is no spasticity or clonus.  There is some reduction of right hip 
internal rotation with pain reported.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign 
is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 27, 2022.  There is severe spinal canal stenosis at 
L3-4 and L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is moderate 
canal stenosis at L2-3.  There is a degenerative anterolisthesis at L4-5.  On personal 
review of the images there appears to be disc material on the left at L5-S1 
compromising the lateral recess.
Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication, and there 
are some nerve root tension signs on the left.  There are corresponding findings on 
MRI that would account for her symptoms.  Given the lack of substantive 
improvement, the reports of intermittent perineal numbness, and the affect that the 
symptoms are having on her quality of life, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with 
self-directed exercises.  She can continue with the chiropractic care if she finds 
benefit.

204,649,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain, and pain and paresthesia 
into the left lower limb as far as the great toe.  The onset was in May 2022 and 
while conservative therapies do provide some relief, she does not indicate any 
significant improvement overall.  She notes some progressive weakness and foot 
drop of the left foot.  There is an increase in pain at night. She does find being in 
water helpful.  There is no change to bowel or bladder function, but she notes 
urinary frequency.  There is no saddle anesthesia or perineal numbness.  She has 
been prescribed exercises.  She is able to manage her ADLs, but has had to hire a 
housecleaner.
Medications for pain include: Lyrica 75 mg bid, Tramacet prn qhs, and Tramadol 200 
mg.  Other medications include: Smith, Smith, Voltaren, Synthroid and Pantaloc.

cardinal findings are severe DDD at L2-3.  There is spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 and 
synovial cyst.  There is left L4-5 foraminal stenosis.  There is a superior disc 
extrusion at L1-2.
Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication and there are signs of left L5 
radiculopathy.  Her back pain is mechanical.  I explained to her that surgical 
intervention is more likely to help her lower extremity symptoms rather than back 
pain.  I am concerned about progressive left foot weakness and given the ongoing 
leg pain, the examination and MRI findings, and continuing impact on her quality of 
life, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I 
have also referred her to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for consideration of medial 
branch block and rhizotomy to hopefully help with her back pain.  She has found 
some relief with osteopathy and she can continue with this if she finds relief.  I have 
encouraged her to continue with self-directed exercises.

weakness of the left foot and has been prescribed an AFO.  She relates incomplete 
voiding and some perineal numbness.  Ms. Smith says that the leg pain and foot 
weakness began in April.  She had some physical therapy without relief and has tried 
stretches without relief.  Her sitting and walking tolerance is reported to be 5 to 10 
minutes.  
Ms. Smith's medical history is remarkable for essential hypertension and 
dyslipidemia.  She had breast cancer about 20 years ago and had a mastectomy.  
She does not smoke and does not have any allergies.  Prior surgeries are reported 
limited to the mastectomy and hysterectomy.  Ms. Smith can only do very light 
chores at home.

significant lateral recess stenosis at L4-5, worse on the left.
Ms. Smith presents with sign and symptoms of left leg radiculopathy and foot drop.  
Given the lack of improvement in pain, motor deficit, examination and MRI findings, I 
am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. G. Guha.  She should 
continue using the AFO and perform activities to tolerance.  She does report 
incomplete bladder voiding and is also reporting some perineal numbness, and given 
this and the weakness, and I have asked Dr. Guha's office to expedite the 
consultation.  Should she experience an inability to void she should seek immediate 
medical attention.

total knee replacement on the right and partial on the left.  He has had an 
appendectomy and inguinal hernia repair.  
Medications include Tridural 100 mg qhs, Rosuvastatin 10 mg, and Escitalopram 10 
mg.
On physical examination Mr. Smith presented using a walker.  There is an anterior 
list of his torso.  An increase in pain is reported with lumbar extension.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+, except for right Achilles which is 1+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 
to S1, except for the left EHL and resisted left foot dorsiflexion which were 4/5.  
Sensation is preserved to sharp and light touch in all dermatomes.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Supine straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits and pain free.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There is no spasticity or clonus.
There is no current MRI.  A lumbar MRI was performed in 2015 which revealed 
lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and significant left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms and signs of left L5 radiculopathy and neurogenic 
claudication.  He may be a surgical candidate, but updated MRI imaging is required 
first.  I have requisitioned the MRI, but I work under medical directives here at HGH 
where the wait times can be long.  He may wish to consider discussing with his 
physician about a requisition elsewhere with shorter wait times.  Mr. Smith should 
be continuing with self-directed exercises.

208,655,"Ms. Smith presents with a history of lower back and left leg pain.  The lower back 
pain began with a fall in January 2022 and there was no significant leg pain at that 
time.  In March she was placed on a more strenuous job at work which involved 
repetitive lumbar flexion, and this is when the leg pain began.  Currently, the leg 
pain is worsening and she reports some urinary retention with pain, but this may be 
related to some other UTI issue.  There is no perineal numbness.  She has had 
chiropractic care for upper back and neck pain which helps, but treatment for her 
lower back (some type of supine maneuver) has not back pain.  She attends for 
physical therapy weekly consisting of dry needling and decompression (traction).  
Ms. Smith is also performing self-directed exercises at home.  She has not had any 
injections.  Ms. Smith continues to work, but has been provided with modified 
duties on a different line.
Her health is reported to be otherwise good.  She has a history of reflex syncope due 
to low blood pressure.  She does not have any known allergies and does not smoke.  
Prior surgeries include: hysterectomy (July 6, 2022), breast reduction, left ankle 
ORIF, tubal ligation and wisdom teeth removal.

Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the left EHL 
which is 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  Muscle tone 
and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is 
negative bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 17, 2022 at St. Joseph's hospital.  The cardinal 
finding is a left paracentral disc protrusion at L4-5 with abutment and minimal 
displacement of the left L5 nerve root.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a left L5 radiculopathy. There is 
corresponding finding on MRI.  She continues to be significantly impeded due to leg 
dominant pain, and has not been able to return to her regular work duties.  Given 
the leg dominant worsening pain, the examination and MRI findings, and given that it 
has been 5 months with no substantive relief with conservative care, I am referring 
Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation.  She is being referred to Dr. Smith, 
neurosurgeon.  In the interim, for her back pain she should trial up to 10 sessions of 
side posture spinal manipulation.  She should be continuing with home-based 
exercises.

221,694,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left sided lower back and posterior thigh pain.  Pain 
was previously traveling distal to the knee.  She has had lower back pain for about 5 years 
and left leg pain began in December 2021.  Ms. Smith has had physical therapy without 
significant relief.  She has had 3 acute severe flare ups of back and leg pain.  She has 
difficulty completing chores at home and navigating stairs.
Review of her medical history reveals that her health is otherwise good.  She is allergic to an 
antibiotic, but could not recall the name.  She is a non-smoker.  She has a history of OA of 
the knee, right more than left, and is awaiting an orthopedic surgical consultation.  Her 
surgical history includes having had left ACL repair, and arthroscopic procedures of both 
knees.
The physical examination reveals that Ms. Smith walks with a normal, reciprocal gait.  She 
was not using any supports.  She stands 5'0"" and weighs 150 lbs.  There is no antalgia.  
There is an increase in pain with lumbar extension.  Ms. Smith could heel and toe walk 
without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and right Achilles, but 1+ 
on the left Achilles.  Power L5 to S1 was graded 5/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+, except for diminished left biceps reflex.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed December 11, 2021 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Smith.  
There is a Grade I listhesis at L3-4 and L4-5.  There is severe canal stenosis at L4-5 and 
moderate at L2-3.  There is severe facet arthropathy at multiple levels.  There is a left L5-S1 
disc bulge and displacement of the left S1 nerve root.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of left S1 radiculopathy.  There is significant spinal 
stenosis at L4-5 and L2-3, but my impression is that her buttock and leg pain is largely 
stemming from the L5-S1 level.  Her difficulties navigating stairs may be more related to 
her knees for which she awaits a surgical consultation.  Given the ongoing left lower 
extremity pain and failure to respond to conservative care, I am referring Ms. Smith for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with 
self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

is numbness at the great toe.  The onset was years ago and pain is worsening.  She has 
limited walking and standing tolerance.  Physical therapy and acupuncture provided 
temporary relief.  Ms. Smith continues with yoga exercises.  She reports a secondary 
complaint of numbness and ache in the right arm.
Her medical history is remarkable only for hypothyroidism.  She has a chiari malformation.  
She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day.  There are no known allergies.  Her 
surgical history includes: right sholder, endometriosis, tubal ligation, and breast reduction.

L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the left EHL which is graded 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished 
along the left L5 dermatome.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is 
non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+, except for sluggishness of the right triceps.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There 
are no long tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was perforemd May 19, 2022.  The cardinal finding is left L4-5 foraminal and 
lateral recess stenosis/narrowing.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing left L5 radiculopathy.  This is related 
to the lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and compromise of the L5 nerve root.  Given her failure 
to adequately respond to conservative care, functional limitations, my examination and MRI 
results, I am referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim,

right L4-5 disc herniation.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5 radiculopathy and there is corresponding 
finding on MRI.  Given the MRI findings and that her pain remains disabling, I am referring 
her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Consideration could be given to 
referring her for epidural injection which may help with pain control.  She should continue 
with activity to tolerance.

224,698,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain and paresthesia in her legs.  
There is associated weakness.  She describes a band of tightness around her waist (this was 
present prior to cervical spine surgery July 21, 2021).  There is burning midline lower back 
pain.  Ms. Smith has sought physical therapy without relief.  As noted, she had cervical 
spine surgery in 2021 and this improved her right leg motor control issues.  There has been 
increasing left leg and foot tingling and numbness, and there is left leg paresthesia with 
walking/standing. 
Her health is reportedly otherwise good.  She is allergic to penicillin.  She does not smoke.  
She has had total right hip replacement.  She had C9-T1 decompression/fusion July 21, 
2021.  Other surgeries include c-section and breast reduction.  Ms. Smith is retired.  She 
has difficulty with chores at home.
Medications include Gabapentin 900 mg/day, Baclofen and NSAID.
Ms. Smith presented using a cane.  Her gait is slow.  She could not perform heel/toe 
walk.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally, but there is 4 
beats of clonus bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for weakness 
3+/5 of the EHLs bilaterally and to resisted left ankle dorsiflexion 4+/5.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished in the feet in a non-dermatomal pattern.  
Vibration sensation (128 hz tuning fork) was diminished in the feet.  Straight leg raising is 
non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed at Niagara Health April 29, 2022.  There is moderate to severe 
L3-4 canal stenosis.  There is left lateral recess stenosis and severe foraminal stenosis.  An 
MRI of the cervical spine was perrformed June 20, 2022.  There is focal cord signal 
abnormality at C7-T1.  There are multiple levels of foraminal stenosis.  An MRI of the 
thoracic and cervical spine was performed June 21, 2022.  There is cord compression at C7-
T1.  Thoracic spine is unremarkable. 
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms of unilateral neurogenic claudication.  There are long 
tract/pyramidal signs, but I am not certain if this is residual to her prior cervical spine 
surgery.  I have requisitioned a cervical spine MRI with contrast.  Consideration could be 
given to referring her to a pain clinic for possible medial branch/facet joint blocks.  I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  She 
should continue with activity to tolerance and self-directed exercises.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient
"
225,699,"Ms. Smith presents with back and leg pain.  The back pain is chronic, but leg symptoms 
began about 1 year ago.  The pain is mostly through the posterior thighs and there is 
associated weakness and heaviness.  There are increased symptoms with walking, and relief 
with sitting.  She is able to void and there is no perineal numbness.  She does have some 
urinary urgency.  She has been attending at St. Joseph's hospital for RF ablations for her 
back which she finds helpful.  She continues with self-directed exercises.  Her walking and 
standing tolerance is less than 5 minutes.
Review of her health history reveals that she has diabetes and essential hypertension.  She 
is a non-smoker.  There are seasonal allergies.  Her surgical history includes having both 
hips replaced, and left total knee replacement.  She is able to manage chores at home.  She 
was previously swimming.  She has been using a walker for about a year.
The physical examination reveals her to be using the walker.  There is an increase in pain 
with lumbar spine extension.  She could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae adn Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 except 
for the right quadriceps which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion 
are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There 
are no long tract signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed at St. Joseph's hospital on March 24, 2022.  There is multilevel 
degenerative anterolisthesis.  There is multilevel epidural lipomatosis.  There is severe canal 
stenosis at L3-4 and severe facet OA at L4-5.  There is mild to moderate canal stenosis at L2
-3.
Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication.  This is related to the epidural 
lipomatosis.  While I am not certain given this etiology what the prognosis would be with 
any surgical intervention, nevertheless a surgical consultation is reasonable in view of her 
functional limitations.  I am referring Ms. Smith to Dr. Smith for his expert opinion.  
She should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

226,701,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and leg pain, mostly into the 
posterior thighs, but sometimes into the lateral legs.  The symptoms are chronic but 
have worsened over time.  She reports very limited standing and walking tolerance 
of less than 5 minutes.  She has been prescribed flexion based exercises which she 
does.  Her health history includes advanced OA of the knees and she says that her 
knee surgeon will be performing knee replacement surgery, but wanted to have her 
lumbar spine addressed first.
Other than the knee OA, her health history includes dyslipidemia and essential 
hypertension.  She is allergic to Demerol.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.  She relates 
that she has never had any surgeries.
Medication for pain is Gabapentin, but this is not helping very much.  Other 
medications include: telmisartan, duloxetine, Nexium, rosuvastatin, atenolol, 
amlodipine.
The physical examination reveals her habitus to be endomorphic.  She is not using 
any supports.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  She could 
not perform heel and toe walking.  There is some non-pitting edema at the ankles 
and feet .  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are 
within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.  There is no spasticity or clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 14, 2022 at HGH.  There is severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L3-4 and moderate to severe at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative 
changes.  There is severe foraminal stenosis at L3-4.  Xrays of the lumbar spine 
performed July 22, 2021 reveal a convex right lumbar scoliosis and graded I 
anterolisthesis L4 on L5. 
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms and functional limitations commensurate with 
neurogenic claudication.  There are corresponding findings on MRI with severe canal 
stenosis.  I have encouraged her to continue with self-directed flexion-based 
exercises, and have also referred her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.

"
227,702,"She had noticed gastrointestinal upset in the prior few weeks but is otherwise healthy, 
other than hypothyroidism. She
smokes about 5 cigarettes per day. There are no known allergies. Ms. Smith is a single 
mother to three small children ages, 4, 5 and 11 years old. She cannot do the bulk of 
household chores due to pain. The physical examination findings revealed she stands 5'4"" 
and weighs 140 lbs. She walks with a limp favoring her right leg. There was an increase in 
pain with lumbar
flexion and extension. She could not perform toe walking. Muscle stretch reflexes were 2+ 
at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally. Power is graded 5/5, except for the right EHL which 
was 4+/5. Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical. Sensation was diminished along the right 
L5 dermatome. Straight leg raising was positive on the right. Hip ranges of motion were 
within normal limits and pain free. Upper limb reflexes were 2+. Hoffman's sign was  absent 
bilaterally.
Ms. Smith presented with signs and symptoms of radiculopathy and I suspected lower 
lumbar disc herniation. A lumbar MRI was required.
The lumbar MRI was performed October 27, 2022 at GNMI.  There is a moderate to large 
right L5-S1 disc protrusion.  There is disc bulging at L4-5.
On follow-up today Ms. Smith says that she continues to have the leg pain and numbness 
and symptoms are even worse. The pain is significantly impeding her quality of life, and her 
walking tolerance is less than 5 minutes.  There is no change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and no perineal numbness.  She is taking Tylenol/Advil prn, and Smith prn.  
The physical examination findings today are substantially similar to when I initially saw her.  
There is a positive SLR on the right, and weakness of the right EHL and FHL 4/5.
My clinical impression remains the same.  Ms. Smith is experiencing right leg 
radiculopathy from the disc herniation at L5-S1.  At this time I am referring her for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also referred her for epidural injection to see 
if this calms her symptoms in the interim.  She should continue with exercises and activity 
to tolerance.

231,723,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and posterior thigh pain.  The onset 
was in June 2022 and she has experienced some improvement since having an epidural 
injection.  She continues to experience paresthesia in her feet .  Physical therapy has helped 
a little and there is no disruption of sleep.  There is no change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and no perineal numbness.  She is able to manage her daily activities with 
pacing.
Her medical history is remarkable for diabetes and essential hypertension.  She does not 
have any allergies.  Ms. Smith does not smoke.  She relates not having any 
surgeries.
Medication for pain is limited to Pregabalin 100 mg qhs at this point.  She was previously 
taking Smith and Celecoxib.  Other medications include: Jardiance 25 mg, Janumet 
1000/100 mg, Glicazide MR 30 mg, Coversyl 8 mg, Simvastatin 5 mg.

233,730,"Mr. Smith was seen initially September 30, 2022.  He reported left buttock, thigh and 
lateral knee pain.  The onset was in early August with lifting.  He has had physical therapy 
and chiropractic care without relief.  He is able to get restful sleep.  His health history is only 
remarkable for epilepsy.  Mr. Smith is a non-smoker.  He is limited in his ability to do 
chores at home.
The physical examination reveals that he stands 183 cm and weighs 87 kg.  His gait and 
cadence is normal.  There is an increase in pain with flexion.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+.  
Power is 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left, and there is some 
crossover with right SLR.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  I noted that 
a lumbar MRI was performed at GNMI on September 20, 2022.  There is a left L3-4 T2 
enhancing lesion in the lateral recess.  The radiologist provides differentials of possible 
nerve sheath tumour or synovial cyst.  On personal review of the images I felt it may be disc 
material with atypical enhancement given the history of onset.  Mr. Smith was diagnosed 
wtih left leg radicular symptoms with L4 nerve root involvement.  An MRI with contrast was 
requisitioned and I was to follow up with him post MRI.  I encouraged him to continue with 
self-directed exercises.
On follow-up today Mr. Smith says that his pain remains the same.  There continues to be 
left buttock and left thigh pain to the lateral knee, and some pain in the leg.  As noted, he 
has not experienced any significant relief with conservative management.  He is able to get 
restorative sleep.  He estimated having experienced 20 to 25% improvement.  He is not 
taking any pain relieving medication.
The MRI with contrast was performed October 11, 2022.  The radiologist notes the T2 
hyperintense lesion at L3-4, but favours within differentials an extruded disc.  This fits with 
the history and my impression.
At this point, given the limited improvement, functional limitations, and imaging findings, I 
am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He should 
continue with exercises and activity to tolerance.

238,740,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right  buttock, leg and foot pain and paresthesia. 
 The onset was years ago, and increased with walking and standing.  There is some 
improvement with sitting.  He describes weakness with prolonged walking.  He describes 
that his leg feels cold.   There is pain intermittently at night.  He attends physical therapy 
weekly and occasionally massage.
His medical history is only remarkable for dyslipidemia.  He has a history of lower back pain. 
 His health is otherwise good.  He underwent right total knee replacement in 2018.  Mr. 
Batchelor is a non-smoker.  He is allergic to bee/wasp venom.  He is retired and can still 
work out and golf.
The physical examination reveals that he stands 6'1"" and weighs 220 lbs.  His gait and 
cadence is normal.  He could heel and toe walk.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ except for 
the right Achilles which is 1+.  Sensation is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  
Power is graded 5/5 except for the right EHL which is 4+/5.  Hip ranges of motion are 
within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
Slump testing is positive on the right, but supine straight leg raising is non-provocative.
A lumbar MRI was performed September 23, 2020.  There is severe spinal canal stenosis at 
L4-5.  There is moderate left foraminal stenosis.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5/S1 radiculopathy.  He also appears to 
have neurogenic claudication.  Given the lack of improvement despite conservative 
management, MRI findings from 2020 and physical examination, I am referring him for

has essential hypertension.  She is allergic to sulpha.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.  She has 
had both knees replaced.
The physical examination reveals that she walks with a slight limp favouring the left leg.  
She is using a cane.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  She 
could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed at GNMI on July 4, 2022.  The cardinal findings on personal 
review appear to be advanced left  lateral recess stenosis at L5-S1 and also L4-5 due to a 
combination of degenerative changes.  Smith's disease is noted.  There is moderate right 
and moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1. 
Ms. Smith has left leg radicular symptoms and unilateral neurogenic claudication.  It is my 
impression that this is related to the lateral recess stenosis at L5-S1 and L4-5.  Given the 
lack of substantive improvement despite the passage of time and the examination findings, 
I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, 
she should continue with self-directed exercises, and physical therapy and chiropractic care 
if she finds it helpful.

241,751,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and leg pain, right worse than left.  He has 
limited standing and walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes. The onset was insidious in 
March 2022 and he has not experienced any significant relief.  This is despite attending for 
physical therapy.  Epidural injections (2) provided relief for about a month.  Mr. Smith says 
his sleep is disturbed due to lower back pain.  He is very limited in his ability to perform 
chores at home.
Medications include Tylenol 600 mg OD, Tramadol bid, and Gabapentin 400 mg tid.  His 
health is otherwise good.  He relates that he a minor stroke in July 2022 and was on blood 
thinners for a short time, but is no longer on them.  Mr. Smith is a non-smoker.  The only 
surgery he reports having had was a hernia surgery.
Mr. Smith stands 5'7"" and weighs 160 lbs.  He walks using a cane in his left hand.  There is 
no antalgia.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to

is severe spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 from a combination of degenerative changes.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  He has 
very limited functioning and walking/standing tolerance.  He uses a cane and has a walker 
at home.  The MRI reveals severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and physical therapy has not helped 
very much in improving his functioning.  I therefore am referring Mr. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  In the interim, he 
should be continuing with flexion-based exercises.

243,756,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was as a result of a 
fall in the summer of 2021.  She has experienced improvement and estimates it at 50%.  She 
has not had any physical therapies, but did have injections (intramuscular?) in Serbia which 
helped.  There tends to be an increase in pain with transitioning from lying down to 
standing.  There is no change to bowel or bladder functioning, and no perineal numbness.  
Ms. Smith reports to me that she is scheduled to have a bone mineral density study this

Ms. Smith is status post T12 compression fracture.  She has mechanical lower back pain.  
Up to date xrays were performed today and there is progression of the compression 
fracture and marked wedging at T12.  Notwithstanding that more than a year  has elapsed 
since her fall, I feel it reasonable that we obtain an opinion as to whether she may be a 
candidate for kyphoplasty.  I am referring her for Dr. D. Guha.  Concomitantly, I am referring 
her to a pain clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet joint blocks to see if this may 
help with her back pain.  She should be continuing with self-directed exercises.  She could 
consider gentle spinal mobilization to the lower lumbar spine on a trial basis of perhaps 6 
to 8 sessions over a month.  The results of the bone mineral density study will be of help to 
Dr. Guha in his clinical decision making.

relieved with sitting.  There is no reported urinary retention and no perineal numbness.  Mr. 
DeBoer has tried osteopathy without relief.  He sees a chiropractor monthly, but this is 
more for shoulder and upper pain and he finds relief with these areas, but not much the 
lower back.  He is retired and able to manage chores around the home.
Mr. Smith is not taking any pain relieving medications.  Medications include: 
methotrexate, atenolol, rosuvastatin, olmsartan, metformin, chlorthalidone, Smith.
His medical history includes psoriatic arthritis which affects his wrists and ankles mostly.  He 
has diabetes, essential hypertension and dyslipidemia.  He does not have any allergies.  Mr. 
DeBoer smokes about 20 cigarettes per day.  He has had prior surgery on his left thigh. 
The physical examination reveals that he stands 5'10 and weighs 220 lbs.  His gait and 
cadence is normal.  There was no antalgia.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine 
extension.  Mr. Smith could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes 
are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  
Muscle bulk and tone is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight 
leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed June 10, 2022 at Niagara Health System.  There are multilevel 
degenerative changes, most significant at L3-4 where there is moderate to severe canal 
stenosis.  There is advanced facet arthropathy at L3-4 and L4-5.

"
252,783,"Mr. Smith presents with a history of back, buttock and proximal thigh pain.  The majority 
of his pain is in the buttocks, mostly left.  He can no longer run due to his symptoms.  The 
onset of symptoms was about 1 year ago and is worsening.  There is no urinary retention or 
perineal numbness, but there is some bowel urgency.  He tried chiropractic care without 
relief and continues with self directed exercises.  He works as an Air Traffic Controller and 
continues to work.
Mr. Smith is taking Advil 1600 mg per day for pain relief.  Other medications include 
ezetimibe, ticagrelor, and esomeprazole.  His health history includes having a cardiac stent 
implanted.  He has environment allergies.  He does not smoke.  He has a histoyr of labral 
tear of the right hip.  His surgical history includes ACL repair and septoplasty, in addition to 
the cardiac stent.
Mr. Smith stands 6'0"" and weighs 200 lbs.  His gait and cadence is normal.  There was no 
antalgia.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  Mr. Smith could heel 
and tow walk without difficulty.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion were within normal limits.  There is a 
positive FADIR test on the right.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  
Straight leg raising on the left caused left buttock pain.  Right SLR is unremarkable.  There is 
tenderness at the lumbo-sacral junction and over the superior gluteal musculature.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 15, 2022 at GNMI.  There is moderate to severe L3-4 
canal stenosis from a combination of degenerative changes.  It is my opinion that the 
cardinal finding may be in fact the L5-S1 level where there is disc degeneration and severe 
bilateral foraminal stenosis.  There is also a retrolisthesis at this same level.
Mr. Smith has predominantly buttock and sometimes pain into the proximal thighs, worse 
on the left.  His symptoms are not typical for neurogenic claudication.  Rather, I believe that 
his symptoms may in fact be stemming from the L5-S1 level and L5 nerve root irritation.  
Given the worsening pain, lack of response to chiropractic care and exercises, and imaging 
findings, I am referring him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  
I have recommended that he continue with flexion based exercises.  I have also referred him 
to a pain clinic for consideration of transforaminal epidural injection and possible medial 
branch blocks.

"
254,787,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg to the lateral toes.  The pain 
started as lower back pain about a year ago and the left leg pain has been present for a 
couple of months.  She has not experienced any significant improvement, and in fact 
reports pain is worsening.  She does not report any change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She has tried physical 
therapies, chiropractic care, massage and acupuncture without relief.  She has had recent 
intramuscular injection without relief, and is scheduled for epidural injection in December.  
She is not performing any exercises.  She cannot work and can only do very light chores at 
home.
Medication for pain includes: Pregabalin 50 mg qhs and Tylenol 2 1 q6h.  Her health is 
reported to be otherwise good.  She is allergic to gluten.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of 
cigarettes per day.  The only surgery she reports having had was a c-section.
The physical examination reveals that she walks with a limp favouring her left leg and was 
in very obvious physical distress.  She sat antalgic to the right.  There is an increase in pain 
with flexion and extension of the lumbar spine.  She could heel and toe walk.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and right Achilles, but 1+ on the left.  Power is graded 
5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for left FHL which is 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along the 
left S1 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 22, 2022 at KMH.  There is a very large L5-S1 more 
prominent on the left side but filling most of the spinal canal and some possible 
compromise of the sacral nerve roots.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of worsening left S1 radiculopathy.  Given the disabling 
nature of her worsening pain, examination and imaging findings, I am referring her for 
spine surgical consultation.  Fortunately, Dr. Smith was in the clinic today and agreed to 
see her.  Further comment is deferred to Dr. Smith's consultation.  Ms. Smith should be 
performing activities to tolerance.  She asked me about medications and I recommended 
she consult with her physician about possibly increasing the dose of the Pregabalin, and 
perhaps a tricyclic such as Smith to help her sleep.

and he does not smoke.  Prior surgeries include to the left index finger and a vasectomy.  
He is able to manage his chores at home.
On physical examination Mr. Smith was observed to walk with a normal gait.  He was using 
a cane with a seat.  He stands 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 190 pounds.  There is an increase 
in pain with lumbar spine extension.  Flexion is relieving.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at 
the patella and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  
Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg 
raising is negative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+. Hoffmann sign is negative bilaterally.
A lumbar spine MRI was performed June 7, 2022 at GN MRI.  This reveals a cardinal finding 
of severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There 
is severe degenerative disc disc disease at L5-S1 with facet incompetence also noted at L4-
5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith has symptoms commensurate with neurogenic 
claudication.  There are corresponding findings on MRI.  Given his significant functional 
limitations I am referring him for surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  
Flexion-extension studies performed were performed today.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith 
to continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

266,828,"Review of his medical history reveals a history of dyslipidemia but he is otherwise healthy.  
He does have osteoarthritis of his knees.  There are no known allergies.  He does not 
smoke.  He has had prior rotator cuff surgery on the right as well as right knee surgery.  
Medications include ezetimibe and Crestor.  Mr. Smith is retired and is limited with his 
ability to perform activities of daily living.  He is able to golf if he uses a cart.
Mr. Smith stands 6 feet 1 inches and weighs 214 pounds.  His gait and cadence was 
normal.  He was not using any supports.  There was an increase in pain with lumbar spine 
extension.  He could not perform toe walking.  Reflexes are 2+ at the patella and Achilles 
bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight 
leg raising is not provocative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and 
pain-free.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffmann sign is absent bilaterally.  There is no 
clonus or any spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed at GMI on July 22, 2022.  This reveals severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 and moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  
There is a disc bulge at L4-5 but on personal review it was more of a herniation after I 
looked at the images.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms that are commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  
At this point in time given his failure to respond to conservative measures, the significant 
limitation in walking and standing, with tolerance of less than 5 minutes, as well as the 
imaging findings, I am referring him on for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  In 
the interim he should continue with flexion-based exercises and activity to tolerance.

A lumbar MRI was performed May 27, 2022 at GNMI.  This reveals a cardinal finding of 
severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5.  There is facet osteoarthritis at the same level.
Ms. Tally presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  Given the 
ongoing leg dominant symptoms and the lack of improvement despite conservative 
measures as well as the impact that the symptoms are having on her quality of life I am 
referring her for a spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Ms. Tally should continue 
with self-directed flexion-based exercises.

269,834,"Ms. Smith presents with a history of leg pain, left more than right, which began about a 
year and a half ago.  There was worsening pain to the feet and an increase in pain with 
walking.  More recently she has experienced marked improvement with medication 
including Toradol and pregabalin but dosages are not known.  She is performing exercises 
and yoga which helps a little.  She has not had any formal physical therapies.  She does not 
report any urinary retention and there is no perineal numbness.  She is able to manage 
chores at home.
A review of her medical history reveals that she was in a recent motor vehicle accident 
which exacerbated back pain.  She has a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism.  More 
recently she has has swollen lymph nodes at her mandibular angle and this is being further 
investigated.  She has seasonal allergies.  She smokes about a pack of cigarettes per day.

4 and moderate at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is moderate to 
severe left foraminal stenosis at L4-5.
My clinical impression is Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication related to the 
spinal stenosis.  She is concerned about being on medications and the effect on her liver 
longer-term.  She did try to titrate down on the pain relieving medications but her 
symptoms increased.  Therefore I am referring her on for a spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. D. Guha.  Pending this consultation she may wish to trial some physical therapy and she 
should be continuing with self-directed flexion-based exercises.  I have recommended that 
she follow-up with the advanced practice professional in the community for exercise review.

"
271,840," Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left leg painful paresthesia which began about 9 
months ago and which is not improving.  She has significant functional limitations with 
walking and standing of less than 5 minutes.  The pain starts in the left buttock travels to 
the foot.  She has had physical therapy without relief.  She does not report any change to 
her bowel or bladder functioning and there is no perineal numbness.  She has not had any 
injections.
Medications include naproxen and oxycodone.  Other medications include ramipril, 
clopidogrel, Smith, pantoprazole, prednisone, diclofenac, nitroglycerin, metoprolol and 
amlodipine.
The medical history reveals that she suffered a myocardial infarction last month but did not 
require any stenting.  She has a history of osteoarthritis and asthma.  She had lumbar spine 
fusion surgery in 2008 with Dr. Smith.  She has paresthesia through the left hand.  She has 
allergies including environmental allergies and to mold.  She does not smoke.  Her surgical 
history includes otherwise hysterectomy and tonsillectomy.  She has significant difficulty 
with her activities of daily living and has been using a walker.
On physical examination her habitus is endomorphic.  She was using a walker to help her 
ambulate.  There is an anterior list of her torso.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar 
spine extension.  Reflexes are 2+ at the patella and Achilles.  Power is graded 5/5 except for 
the left EHL which is 3+/5 and to resisted left foot dorsiflexion is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  Slump and 
straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman sign is negative bilaterally.
A CT of the lumbar spine was performed June 6, 2022 and reveals severe foraminal stenosis 
at L5-S1.  Extensive lumbar hardware is noted.  On personal review there is appear apparent 
failure of lumbosacral hardware.  There is extensive vacuum phenomenon of the L5-S1 disc. 
 The spinal canal could not be adequately visualized due to hardware artifact, but it is 
apparent that there is fairly significant foraminal stenosis, more so on the left.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing left L5 radiculopathy.  Fortunately 
today Dr. Smith was in the clinic and he graciously agreed to see Ms. Smith.  Plain film 
radiographs were performed which reveals hardware failure and L5-S1 disc collapse.  Dr. 
Smith has scheduled her for remedial surgery but this may take some time.  Further 
comment is deferred to Dr. Smith's report.  Ms. Smith did ask me about medication 
options and I defer to her physician but I query whether a neuromodulator such as 
gabapentin may be helpful.  She did say that she did not have any success with Lyrica.  I 
have recommended that she continue with activity to tolerance.

272,841,"Ms. Smith presents with right leg pain which began in August 2022.  The pain is 
through the anterior leg to the ankle and there is also pain through the right groin.  She 
had physical therapy which was not helpful.  She denies any change to her bowel or bladder 
functioning and there is no perineal numbness.  She is not doing much in the way of any 
exercises currently.  Most of her pain is through the right groin and buttock.  She is taking a 
neuromodulator, the name of which she could not recall.
Review of her medical history reveals diabetes and hypertension.  She had a total left knee 
replacement and revision in 2021.  She has osteoarthritis of the shoulders and hips and has 
had cortisone injections to her shoulders and left hip.  She is allergic to codeine.  She does 
not smoke.  Her surgical history includes mastectomy for breast cancer, hysterectomy, as 
well as the left total knee replacement.  Medications include metformin, insulin and an 
antihypertensive the name of which she could not recall.  Ms. Smith is very limited with 
respect to her abilities to perform activities of daily living.
On physical examination her habitus is endomorphic.  She was in a wheelchair and says that 
she cannot walk for very long.  There was an increase in pain with attempted flexion and 
extension of the lumbar spine.  She could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 1+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally. Power is graded 5/5 except for the 
right quadricep which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical and sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the right with nerve root 
tension.  There is some diminished internal rotation of the right hip with an increase in pain. 
 Upper limb reflexes are 2+ with negative Hoffmann sign.
A lumbar MRI was performed at GMI on October 21, 2022 and this reveals a right-sided L4-
5 foraminal stenosis.
My clinical impression is Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with right L4 nerve 
root irritation and she also may have some right hip internal derangement or arthralgia.  
Plain film radiographs of the hip were performed today but these revealed only mild 
osteoarthritis.  It remains my opinion that there may be internal derangement and possibly 
a labral tear.  She appears to have some right L4 radicular symptoms but there is no 
significant motor deficit other than some mild weakness of the right quadricep.  At this 
point in time she may be a candidate for surgical consultation should she not respond to an 
epidural injection.  I referred her to a pain clinic for consideration of a right L4-5 
transforaminal epidural injection.  I recommend that she be referred into the hip and knee 
hip and knee central intake program for further evaluation.  Should she  respond to the 
injection then surgical consultation will be considered with Dr. Smith.

273,842,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left more than right leg pain.  She 
characterizes the back pain is a sharp sensation.  The leg pains are increased with walking 
and standing.  Flexion provides some relief.  She reports that her walking and standing 
tolerance is no more than about 10 minutes.  She describes some urinary retention but 
there is no perineal numbness or any saddle anesthesia.  She has been prescribed self-
directed exercises. She reports having fallen in February and April 2022 injuring her neck 
and right shoulder.  She had osteopathic treatment which was helpful for some pain relief, 
but it did not improve functioning.  She takes Lyrica and Tylenol.
Review of her medical history reveals that she had prior L45 decompression surgery in 
2016.  Her medical history includes diabetes hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She has 
environmental allergies.  She does not smoke.  She had neck decompression surgery in 
2014.  Medications include metformin, Jardiance, Crestor.

using any supports.  She stands 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 195 pounds.  There was an 
increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  She could not perform heel and toe walking.  
Reflexes are 3+ at the patella and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1.  
This is excepting the left foot dorsiflexion and EHL which were 4/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished along the feet and lower legs but and in stocking 
distribution.  Vibration sense was diminished in the feet.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits and not provocative.  Upper limb reflexes were 2+.  Hoffmann sign is positive 
bilaterally.  There is some spreading of the right brachial radialis reflex.
A lumbar spine MRI was performed at GNMI on June 28, 2022.  This reveals severe 
degenerative disc disease at L4-5 and severe spinal canal stenosis at L5-S1 and less so at L2
-3.  There is severe left foraminal stenosis at L3-4.  MRI of her cervical and thoracic spines 
does not reveal any significant neural compression.
My clinical impression is Ms. Smith has symptoms that are commensurate with neurogenic 
claudication and the severe stenosis that is present in the lower lumbar spine.  I am I am 
not hopeful that any conservative therapy will significantly impact on her functioning at this 
point in time.  I am referring her for surgical consultation with Dr.Smith.  In the interim she 
should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.
