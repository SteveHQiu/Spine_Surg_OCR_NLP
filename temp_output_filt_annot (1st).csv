77,77,247,2022-04-05 00:00:00,Yes,No,No,0,1,124,3,1.0,0.0,0.0,"I have today reviewed this fellow acutely at the General Hospital Fracture Clinic after
he was referred into me by Mr. Dos Santos from the Regional ISEAC program for lumbar
instability issues.
 
He is a 58-year-old very Portuguese construction worker still working despite problem
back pain that came on about a year ago after a fall at work that took him off the job
for fully 6 weeks, settling down only with administration of physiotherapy and injections
from the pain clinic.
 
He has had problem with activity related back pain ever since and struggles a great deal,
and honestly he would be off work if he had WSIB coverage, but he does not and he feels
very distressed.
 
He has had no incontinence or constitutionality with this and pain does ease off a bit
when he rests over the long weekend or something like that.
 
Pain is largely back dominant, but extends globally through the left leg, also the right
thigh.
 
Physical exam shows a tremendously rotund fellow who heaves himself up out of our
examining room chair only with difficulty and has a very short-strided careful gait,
antalgically favoring the left leg.
 
He is honestly to fix that to appreciate much of a bulk and tone in the lumbar spine, but
at the legs, there is an obvious loss of tone in the left quadriceps compared to the
right.  Bulk is the same to my tape measure at the thigh and the calf.  Manual motor
testing finds I can easily over powered his left-sided quadriceps which I should never be
able to do, the right side is rock solid and the foot and ankle motors are all good too.
 
Check x-rays show a left-sided Bertolotti syndrome at the lumbosacral joint with a lytic
grade ____ spondylolisthesis above at L4-5.  MRI confirmed the expected high grade
central and neural foraminal stenosis L4-L5 to explain the symptoms.
 
This is a surgically correctable problem.  He would need an instrumented decompression
and stabilization L4-L5 for optimal prognosis.
 
With his wife attending, I have done my best to explain the pathoanatomy of what is going
on, showed him the scans and explained what would be involved in a corrected operation
with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent time from issues.
 
Before we can go to the operating room, the gentleman needs sleep apnea testing, given
the size I have asked him the questions and sure enough, he is frequently awakening at
night and feels dry in the mouth, so he is probably mouth breathing to try to compensate.
My office can arrange that.
 
Nothing is going to happen quickly at the operating room.  It routinely takes me a good
6-12 months to bring even a fairly urgent case to the theater but I will take consent
today and put him in the list, so I can look after him as I can.
 
In the interim, of course, if things are getting worse, I have asked him to pick up the
phone and call my office so we can jump the queue if need be.
",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left leg pain.  The onset 
was a few years ago, and increased with a fall about 1 year ago.  He has lower back 
pain daily and finds it difficulty to work. He has standing and walking tolerances of 
only about 5 minutes.  He has not notice any significant improvement with exercises.  
Paraspinal injections did not provide him with any relief.  His medical history is 
unremarkable, but he says that he is pre-diabetic.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L4/5 radiculopathy.  
There is weakness of the left quadriceps and left extensor hallucis longus.  There is 
reduced left patellar reflex.  There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  The 
lumbar MRI was performed January 22, 2021 which reveals a Grade 1 anterolisthesis 
with lysis at L4-5.  There is severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally at this level.  There 
is severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and lower lumbar facet arthrosis, worse at L3-4.
In view of the worsening pain despite the passage of time and conservative 
management, his deteriorated quality of life, as well as my examination and MRI 
findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed exercises.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

She is reporting right groin pain.  She has limited walking and standing tolerance.  
She has a history of chronic lower back pain exacerbated with lifting a few months 
ago.  She attends physical therapy weekly which helps a little.  She does yoga and 
bicycles about 10 minutes per day.  Her medical history includes rheumatoid arthritis 
affecting mostly her hands and right knee.  She had a thyroidectomy and takes 
Eltroxin.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  Her 
clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar MRI 
from February 3, 2022 reveals moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 with 
possible impingement of the left L4 nerve root at L3-4.  There is reduced ranges of 
the right hip and recreation on groin pain on provocative testing.
Xrays of her right hip were performed today and these reveal moderate to severe 
osteoarthritis.  I recommend that she be referred into the rapid access hip and knee 
program for further evaluation.  I have also referred her for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha regarding the claudicant symptoms.  She should 
continue with self-directed exercises and can continue with the physical therapy if it 
is helping.

He has noted good improvement in his right leg pain.  He still will occasionally experience what he describes as zaps running down his leg on a random basis.  But the constant and more intense pain is resolved.  He experiences occasional bouts of altered sensation in his foot as well.
 
When I examined him he is slightly hypersensitive in the first webspace and medial foot.  His strength was good on manual muscle testing but he does state he has some difficulties with dorsiflexion towards the end of the day.
 
Given the pain relief that he has experienced I think the ozone procedure has shrunk his disc reasonably well.  I think the ongoing symptoms are likely related to nerve regeneration.  I think he should continue to experience improvement in the symptoms over the next 6 to 9 months.
 
No further follow-up is required.",no imaging,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right foot pain and sometimes into the leg.  
He had a flare up about 1 month ago with lifting, but his symptoms have been 
present for several years.  His sleep is not disturbed due to pain.  He has had 
physical therapy and chiropractic care without significant relief.  He has not had any 
injections.  His general medical history is unremarkable, other than having had 
necrotizing fasciitis as a child requiring multiple surgeries.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is no significant motor deficit, except for weakness of the right EHL.  There is 
no nerve root tension.  An EMG in 2019 revealed findings of L5 radiculopathy.  The 
most recent MRI of his lumbar spine was performed March 29, 2022 which reveals a 
small right L5-S1 paracentral disc herniation.  On personal review of images there is 
marked right foraminal stenosis at the same level with likely impingement of the L5 
nerve root from a combination of degenerative changes, including disc 
protrusion/bulge.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain and foraminal stenosis on MRI, as well as the 
ongoing limitations in functioning, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consideration with Dr. Smith.  We discussed alternatives including intradiscal CT 
guided ozone and I am not certain that he is the best surgical candidate, but given 
the disc protrusion contributing to the stenosis, it is definitely worthwhile having a 
discussion.  He should continue with self-directed exercises.

She has a calcified disc herniation at T7-8.  There is dorsal CSF.  But  the cord is draped over the disc bulge, and there is myelomalacia at that level.  I discussed the case with my colleagues.  In the agree that surgical decompression is warranted given the severity of the myelopathy.
 
She was recently admitted to the hospital for stroke work-up.  However she was not found to have had a stroke, and the findings were due to medication side effects.
 
She has grade 4 power in the lower extremities.  She is severely ataxic.  She is using a walker.
 
I am offering Maureen T7-8 posterior decompression instrumented fusion with transpedicular decompression.  We will try to expedite this as she seems to be worsening and that her motor exam is now worse than previous.
 
Goal of surgery is to halt progression of her myelopathy.  She may not have improvement in her neurologic symptoms.
 
We discussed complications including, but not limited to: dural tear; infection; wound complications; bleeding; injury to: major vessels, major organs; nerve root or spinal cord injury; failure to improve symptoms;weakness; numbness; bowel or bladder dysfunction;  pseudoarthrosis/instrumentation failure; adjacent segment degeneration; revision surgery; malalignment; wrong-level surgery; blood clot; anesthesia-related risks such as pulmonary/cardiac/cerebrovascular complications, including death, paralysis, and blindness.
 
All questions were answered.  She wished to proceed.
",no imaging,"With regard to her lower back pain, I have recommended to Ms. Smith that she 
follow-up with her pain clinic.  Consideration could be given to facet joint/medial 
branch block injections.  I am referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith regarding the thoracic disc protrusion and cord compression, notwithstanding 
that there are no clear signs of myelopathy on physical examination.  Ms. Smith is 
encouraged to continue with activities to tolerance.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and also right more than leg 
pain paresthesia.  He estimates that 80% of his difficulties pertain to his lower back.  
He has had physical therapy and osteopathy with temporary relief of pain.  He has 
also had hip injections which has provided temporary relief.  He is working 2 1/2 
days per weeks.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with mechanical back pain and neurogenic 
claudication.  There is no significant neurological deficit, other than mild weakness of 
the left EHL.  A lumbar MRI was performed November 3, 2021 reveals severe spinal 
canal stenosis at L4-5 and moderate foraminal stenosis.  There is severe lateral 
recess stenosis at L3-4, worse on the left.
Given the back dominance of his pain, I have referred him for consideration of 
medial branch blocks/facet joint blocks.  I have encouraged him to continue with 
self-directed exercises to maintain his mobility.  I am also referring him for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha with regard to the severe canal stenosis and 
claudicant symptoms.

She is a lady with severe insufficiency fracture of T12 causing 30 degrees of kyphosis.
She has back pain.  She has difficulties with standing upright.
 
Thank you for sending along the bone density scans.  T scores were ranged from negative
0.9 to negative 2.4.  She is negative 2.4 on the femoral neck.
 
MRI shows retropulsed fragment causing effacement of the cord at T12.  CT scan confirms
the bony compression fracture.
 
She is neurologically intact.  No long tract signs.  She does have bilateral knee
arthritis.
 
I offered a pedicle subtraction osteotomy at T12 to correct the kyphosis, to stabilize
due to the 3-column osteotomy and osteoporosis ____ T9-L3 posterior decompression
instrumented fusion T12 pedicle subtraction osteotomy.
 
I explained to her that this is a very large procedure with complications can occur.
 
Commonly neurologic issues do occur.  Usually this is radiculopathy which in her case
would manifest as either radicular pain in the chest or pain in the anterior thigh.  Very
rarely people experience some more profound neurologic deficit, in which case we would be
paraplegia and/or bowel or bladder dysfunction.  We will use neuro monitoring for the
procedure.

Procedure will require ventral dissection.  This could result in blood loss, as well as a
pneumothorax which could require a chest tube.

We also discussed other risks, including but not limited to, CSF leak, infection, wrong
level surgery, pseudoarthrosis and adjacent degeneration which are important concerns in
her along with the risks of anesthesia including death, paralysis, blindness, stroke,
heart attack.
 
The patient ____ by his symptoms and wants to proceed.
 
Consent was obtained.  We will go ahead and schedule the procedure.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was insidious in 
September 2021.  She is also experiencing achiness at the anterior legs.  She is also 
describing a burning sensation in her feet, and she has bilateral knee pain.  She is 
able to void her bladder and there is no perineal numbness.  She reports to me that 
she is scheduled to have bilateral knee replacements.  Her health in general is good 
other than hypertension.  She used to clean houses and has been unable to return to 
work since October 2021.
The physical examination reveals her to be neurologically intact, other than reduced 
vibration sense in her feet.  She has significant genu Smith bilaterally.  She is 
status post compression fracture of T12 where there is 80% compression and bony 
retropulsion.  
At this time, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In preparation of the surgical consultation, I have requisitioned 
flexion-extension xray of the lumbar spine.  There is no evidence of instability. I have 
encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with activities to tolerance.  Much of her standing 
and walking limitation appears related to her knee troubles and I anticipate her 
functioning will improve post-knee replacement surgery.

After this informed consent was signed.  Our office will be in contact with her for an operative date.",,"Ms. Howgego presents with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  The onset was 
about 5 years starting with cramping.  The symptoms are increased with walking 
and standing and relieved with sitting and lying down.  She describes paresthesia in 
her feet with lying down.  She has been prescribed exercises, but has not had any 
physical therapy.  For the past few months she has also been experiencing right 
groin pain.  Her medical history is unremarkable, other than a history of IBS.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficiency.  
There is no motor weakness.  There are reduced ranges of the right hip compared 
to the left, which precipitated groin pain.  A lumbar MRI was performed August 22, 
2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5.
Xrays of the right hip and pelvis were requisitioned today.  The radiology report 
notes mild to moderate degenerative changes.  On personal review the degenerative 
changes appear worse on the right.  There also appears to be a degree of 
protrusion acetabuli on the right.  Xray of the lumbar spine in standing was 
performed today for surgical planning.  The study reveals a right convex scoliosis
It is my impression that she is experiencing neurogenic claudication as well as right 
hip arthralgia.  In light of the ongoing leg pain and limited standing and walking 
tolerance (less than 5 minutes), as well as imaging findings, I am referring Ms. 
Howgego for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  At the same time, some 
of her functional problems are in part related to her hip.  I recommend that she be 
referred into the rapid access hip and knee program for further evaluation.  She 
should continue with home-based, self-directed exercises.

One could consider decompression and fusion here if her pain became not manageable with conservative treatment.  However at the present time despite some difficulties Mrs Tiers would like to carry on with conservative treatment.  We did discuss that if her symptoms worsened and she would like to be reassessed by myself that would be perfectly fine and I would just asked Dr. Dul to please send me another referral.,,"Ms. Smith says that her symptoms remain essentially the same.  There is still pain in 
the lower back and posterior thighs, but not radiating past the knees.  The lumbar 
MRI was performed May 17, 2022 and reveals a transitional lumbo-sacral segment.  
There is significant lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and marked facet arthropathy.  
There is a synovial cyst on the right compromising the lateral recess.  There is 
moderate to severe foraminal stenosis, worse on the left at L4-5.
In view of the continuing symptoms, functional limitations and MRI results, as well as 
limited response to conservative care, I am referring Ms. Tiers for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  With or without surgery, if back pain persists 
consideration could be given to referring Ms. Tiers for facet joint/medial branch 
blocks at the L4-5 level.  She can continue with the conservative therapies she has 
been undertaking if she finds benefit.  She should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises.

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections And surgery. We mutually agreed to pursue surgery, which was offered in the form of a open or minimally invasive left L5-S1 microdiscectomy. The rationale for the procedure and reasonably forseeable risks were explained, which include but are not limited to, those of general anesthesia, including death, stroke, paralysis and blindness, risks of bleeding and infection potentially requiring revision surgery, and risks specific to this procedure, including cauda equina or nerve root injury with temporary or permanent weakness, numbness and/or loss of bowel/bladder control, durotomy with CSF leak potentially requiring revision surgery, failure of symptomatic improvement,  , index or adjacent segment degeneration including disc reherniation, wrong level surgery. Cynthia asked appropriate questions and provided informed consent.. Our office will arrange for an appointment with the Anesthesia Pre-Operative Clinic, and subsequently arrange an operative date at the earliest opportunity..",no imaging,"The follow-up assessment today was conducted over the telephone.  Ms. Smith 
provided verbal consent to proceed with this consultation.
I initially saw Ms. Smith on April 14, 2022.  She was reporting chronic back pain 
and left leg pain to the foot.  She has had chiropractic care in the remote past which 
was helpful for back pain.  She described the left leg pain as located in the posterior 
thigh and sometimes tingling sensation in her heel.  The physical examination did not 
reveal any significant neurological deficit, but there was nerve root tension on the 
left.   She was scheduled for a lumbar MRI on April 22nd and I recommended to her 
that I follow-up with her afterwards.  I recommended that she continue with 
self-directed exercises and that she could trial manual therapy on her lower back.
Ms. Smith says that she continues to have lower back and left lower extremity pain.  
She has started a new course of physical therapy without relief.  She is taking 8 
Percocet tablets per day for pain relief.  She is able to walk for distance.  Sleep is 
disturbed due to pain.
The MRI was performed April 22, 2022 and reveals an asymmetric left L5-S1 disc 
protrusion.  There is severe right foraminal stenosis at L4-5 and on the left at L5-S1.
In view of the ongoing leg pain, lack of response to exercises and the passage of 
time, and the examination and MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue 
with self-directed exercises.

I have not booked her for routine follow-up at this time however remain available should the need arise in the future. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and bilateral leg pain.  The 
back pain has been present for about 18 months and she characterizes the pain as a 
pressure or stabbing sensation; increased with prolonged sitting, standing and with 
bending.  Lying down provides relief.  Physical therapy, acupuncture and osteopathy 
have not provided her with any significant relief.  She has also had intramuscular 
injections without relief.  She has tried decompression (traction) without relief.  Her 
medical history is unremarkable, other than a history of kidney stones for which she 
has had lithotripsy.
Ms. Smith was employed as an Educational Assistant, but has not been able to 
return to work since November 2021.  She has been using a cane for a couple of 
months to help with her walking tolerance.
The physical examination today suggests that her back pain is mechanical and 
discogenic.  Her leg pain may be related to nerve root irritation.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed August 18, 2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of midline disc protrusion 
at L5-S1 and mild foraminal stenosis.  Ms. Smith says that her symptoms have 
worsened since this MRI and that a requisition for an updated MRI has been placed.
Given the back dominance of her pain, I am not convinced that she is the best 
surgical candidate. However, given the presence of leg pain and MRI findings, I have 
referred her for spine surgical consultation, as she also wished to pursue any 
surgical option.  I have referred her to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon.  I have also 
referred her to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet 
joint blocks.  Notwithstanding the disc protrusion at L5-S1 she could trial up to 10 
sessions of chiropractic spinal mobilization/manipulation.  I have encouraged her to 
continue with self-directed exercises.

leg pain.  He has a longstanding history of lower back pain which he feels has been 
worsening over the last couple of years.  Pain disturbs his sleep.  He is able to void 
and here is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  He has had physical 
therapy and intramuscular injections without relief.  He tries to perform exercises at 
home.  Mr. Smith's medical history includes MI 4 years ago and 3 cardiac stents.  
He suffered a stroke which has left him partially blind.  He smokes about 2 packs of 
cigarettes per day.  He has a stomach ulcer.
Mr. Smith has tried physical therapy and intramuscular injections in the past 
without relief.  He has not had treatment in the past few years. He does not wish to 
pursue further conservative care as he does not think it will help.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is no identified nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 8, 
2021.   The cardinal finding is a small focal right paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1 
and mild right foraminal stenosis.  There appears to be right L5 nerve compression.

back pain is mechanical.  He was insistent that surgical intervention is the best route 
for him at this point.  While I do agree that surgery may help with his right leg pain, 
his health history would indicate that he may not be the best surgical candidate.  
Surgery may not help with his lower back pain.  I am referring him to Dr. D. Guha for 
his opinion.  For his back pain he could trial side posture spinal manipulation, and if 
this doesn't help, then facet joint/medial branch blocks.  He was reluctant/did not 
wish to pursue further conservative care, in part because he doesn't think it will help,

Unsure how to proceed,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of midline lower back pain.  The 
onset was several years ago but pain is worsening.  There is an increase in pain 
with walking and standing, and relief with lying down.  She sought out chiropractic 
care in 2016 without relief.  She does not find that exercises are helping much.  She 
has some bowel urgency, but there is no urinary retention and no perineal numbness 
of saddle anesthesia.  She has limited walking and standing tolerance of about 5 
minutes due to the back pain.  Ms. Smith has occasional numbness in her great 
toes.  Pain can disrupt her sleep and the only medication she is taking is Tylenol 3 
qhs.
Ms. Smith's health history includes having had a right total hip replacement in 
2017, and she is scheduled for a left Smith.  A recent right hip diagnostic ultrasound 
reveals partial thickness tear of the gluteus minimus.  She has just started a new job 
which is sedentary in nature.  She used to work as a driver and teach art, neither of 
which she can do.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
She has mechanical back pain related to a Grade I/II spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.  
There is severe degenerative disc changes and right foraminal stenosis, and 
moderate on the left.  The paresthesia she is experiencing in her great toes is 
related to L5 nerve root irritation.
Given the worsening and disabling lower back pain, MRI findings and notwithstanding 
that she is also scheduled to have her left hip replaced, I am referring Ms. 
Beardwood for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged 
her to remain active to tolerance and continue with self-directed exercises.  Further 
comment is deferred to Dr. Smith.

summer of 2021, but he did have some prior lower back pain/buttock pain.  He 
describes numbness distal to the knee and weakness and foot drop on the left which 
is worsening.  Physical therapy did not provide him with any significant relief.  Mr. 
Kirouac is also describing weakness of his arms.  His medical history includes Smith's 
disease.  He is very limited in his ability to perform chores at home.
Mr. Smith presented in a wheelchair.  There is cyanosis of his feet.  He walks with 
a steppage gait with his left lower limb.  There is marked reduction in power of 
resisted left foot dorsiflexion at 1+/5.  There is also weakness of right foot 
dorsiflexion and EHL.  There is nerve root tension on the left.  A lumbar MRI 
performed March 29, 2022 reveals cardinal findings of severe foraminal stenosis on 
the left at L4-5 and L5-S1.  There is also lateral recess stenosis on the left at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing a left L5 radiculopathy.  Dr. 
Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon, was in the clinic today and kindly agreed to 
see Mr. Smith.  Apparently, further neurogical work up is deemed required, and 
further comment is deferred to Dr. Smith's report.  I have recommended that Mr.

minimize the chance of a fall.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and right leg pain.  The 
onset was in August 2021 without precipitating event recalled.  There is an increase 
in pain with walking and standing, and relief with lying down.  He had physical 
therapy without relief.
The physical examination findings are suggestive of right L3-4 radiculopathy.  There 
are no long tract signs.  A lumbar MRI reveals a disc protrusion at T11-12 with 
displacement of spinal cord and moderate to severe canal stenosis.  There is a small 
foci of hyper intense signal change on T2 weighted images at T12.  There is 
moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L3-4 on the right.
At this time, notwithstanding the absence of signs of myelopathy, but given the 
changes on MRI at T11-12, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  His leg symptoms may be related to the foraminal 
stenosis at L3-4 on the right.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed

numbness at the posterior thighs and legs.  The right thigh pain is worse than the 
left.  He has perineal numbness and reports that he has to exert himself when 
voiding his bladder.  He does indicate he can void.  He says that his feet are 
completely numb.  He did attend for physical therapy for about a month and found 
the treatment/exercises helpful.  Unfortunately, he was cut off from social services 
and cost considerations have prevented him from returning.  The onset of symptoms 
began as back pain, as a result of a motor vehicle accident about 7 years ago and 
his condition has worsened.  His health in general is good.
The physical examination and clinical presentation is consistent with neurogenic 
claudication.  I am concerned about an evolving incomplete cauda equine syndrome 
due to the report of perineal numbness and having to having to exert himself to void 
his bladder.  A lumbar MRI was performed November 15, 2021 and reveals severe 
canal and foraminal stenosis at L4-5 and moderate at L5-S1.
I am referring Mr.  Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I would 
like Mr. Smith to be seen sooner rather than later, and have arranged for him to be 
seen next week.  In the interim, he should be continuing with activities to tolerance.  
Should he experience any bladder retention or if his perineal numbness increases, 
then he has been instructed to attend at the ER at HGH.

If not improving can consider at a later stage  Intervention in the form of IR CT-guided cyst aspiration +/- fibrin glue injection, or open surgery. No routine follow up is required but happy to contact the office for further follow up as required.",,"Mr. Smith reports a chief complaint of left sided burning in the perineum and 
teste.  He sometimes experiences sharp pain in the left buttock.  The onset was 
insidious in October 2021, but he has a prior history of lower back pain.  He says that 
when he urinates he cannot tell if he's finished due to numbness.  He has a prior 
history of left leg pain, but nothing presently. There is an increase in pain with 
sitting, but walking is unremarkable.  He is able to get restful sleep and complete all 
of his activities of daily living.  He attended physical therapy without relief, and 
traction made his pain worse.
His medical history is remarkable for diabetes diagnosed in 2003, dyslipidemia, 
essential hypertension, and a myocardial infarction requiring stenting in 2017.
The history suggests possible incomplete cauda equine syndrome.  There is no 
significant neurological deficit and no lower extremity nerve root tension.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed March 26, 2022 reveals a left L5-S1 disc protrusion with 
displacement of left S1 nerve root.  There is a very large Tarlov cyst in the sacrum.  
Mr. Smith reports having had a pelvic ultrasound which was reportedly 
unremarkable.
At this time, notwithstanding improvement to date, but given the history of left 
buttock and leg pain episodes, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation.  I would not expect the disc protrusion to cause compression of the 
nerve roots that can lead to cauda equine syndrome, but query whether the very 
large Smith cyst may be compromising the sacral nerve roots.  I am referring Mr. 
Smith to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon, for his opinion.  I also recommend that Mr. 
Smith be referred to a Urologist to rule out a urological disorder.  Mr. Smith 
should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

There is no known effective treatment for this, these muscle cells have died often been resorbed and we cannot miraculously reconstitute.  Exercise will do it, as she wants to fly to Mexico I am sure she can find a stem cell clinic that will charge her a few $100,000 to inject some stuff in there, that has been done in research and accomplishes nothing.
 
I spent quite some time with the lady explaining this to her and showing her not just her own scans but those of another patient with normal muscle anatomy so she can see the difference with her own eyes and understand the problem.  The risk here if anything is that she is directed to go doctor shopping and find somebody who thinks he can help her by operating on 1 of these worn-out disks, the surgical incision in the muscle will only damage it further and make her symptoms worse.
 
Sadly she is going to have to live with her pain.
 
She is asked me about her gabapentin which is not helping her at all, I certainly think she could stop at any other time because its sedative and she does not need that.
 
The 1 possibly helpful suggestion I would make is that she should try using some walking sticks to help get around, these tend to support a person in a much more neutrally aligned posture than a walker does not and that may ease her myofascial pains somewhat.
 
Have not made plans to see her further. ",no imaging,"Given the ongoing disabling lower back pain, and notwithstanding the absence of leg 
pain, but in view of the MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  While spine surgical consultation is usually for 
patients with leg dominant pain, given the marked degeneration of the lower lumbar 
spine, I feel it is appropriate that we seek a surgical consultation.  This is especially 
so given the lack of response to conservative care, including interventions such as 
medial branch blocks.  She should continue with activity to tolerance.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock, leg and foot pain.  The pain 
worsens as the day progresses.  The onset was about 3 years ago and there has not 
been any significant improvement.  Physical therapy was not helpful.  He's had a 
couple of epidural injections which provided relief for 5 to 6 weeks. He has limited 
walking and standing tolerance due to his leg pain.  His general medical history is 
remarkable for diabetes and hypertension.  Mr. Smith is not doing much in the way 
of exercises, but has started bicycling.  He cannot sleep on his left side, but this may 
be more related to degenerative changes in his left hip.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There is nerve root tension on the left.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 8, 
2021 reveals lateral recess stenosis bilaterally at L4-5 and L5-S1.
Mr. Smith has left L5/S1 radicular symptoms.  Given the ongoing leg pain, the 
functional limitations, examination findings and MRI results, I am referring Mr. 
Rhodes for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged him to 
continue with self-directed exercises.  I recommend that he be referred into the 
central intake hip and knee program for further evaluation of his left hip.

intermittent.  The onset of symptoms was about 5 years ago.  Mr. Smith was 
attending for massage therapy every three weeks which he found helpful.  He had 
tried physical therapy and chiropractic care in the past without relief.  His medical 
history includes diabetes and hypertension.  The clinical presentation and

Mr. Smith reports on follow-up today that his symptoms remain essentially the same.  
He continues to have left leg dominant pain and limited walking tolerance of about 
half a km.  It remains my opinion that he has left L5 nerve root involvement.  Given

standing tolerance.  Exercises have not been helpful and injections help a little.  
Other than elevated blood glucose levels, his health in general is good.
The physical examination reveals findings commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is nerve root tension on the right and mild weakness of the right EHL.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed December 7, 2021 reveals right L4-5 disc herniation and 
Grade I/II spondylolisthesis.  There is moderate foraminal stenosis bilaterally.
In view of the chronicity and lack of improvement of leg dominant pain, the physical 
examination and the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have recommended that he continue with 
self-directed exercises.

radiate down to the dorsum of the foot potentially consistent with an L4 distribution;
however, also with significant imaging evidence of right hip osteoarthritis, for which
she is about to see an orthopedic surgeon.  Given her fairly mild imaging findings of her
spine, she had a long discussion today regarding the range of options and she would like
to pursue first a nerve root block:
A.  To see if this will help potentially provide durable relief.
B.  For diagnosis to see how much of her pain would resolve following a targeted
injection, in the meantime while she was waiting for assessment for her hip, which does
show clear radiographic arthrosis.
 
I will therefore refer her to a Pain Clinic for a right L3-L4 transforaminal epidural
steroid injection.  I have not scheduled her for a routine followup at this time;
however, should she not obtain durable or adequate relief from this, then she knows to
get in touch with my office for discussion of next steps and at that point it is my hope
that she will also have her hip assessed at that point, so that we can make a clear plan
going forward.",,"Avoid prolonged walking, Avoid prolonged sitting, Avoid prolonged standing, Lumbo-pelvic

Summarizing Paragraph:
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock and leg pain.  
Symptoms are chronic but increased as of October 2021.  Pain is not improving.  She 
has very limited walking tolerance.  She has consulted with a physiatrist who 
performed intraarticular injection in the right hip, but this provided only very 
transient relief.  Her general health is good.
The physical examination reveals findings suggestive of right L4 nerve root irritation.  
However, her clinical presentation and pain levels appeared disproportionate to what 
is seen on the lumbar MRI where there is right L3-4 disc herniation and foraminal 
protrusion.  There is marked reduction in right hip ranges of motion with pain.  Plain 
film radiographs of the right hip were performed today and these reveal moderate to 
severe right hip join degeneration.
My clinical impression is that most of Ms. Smith's functional limitations are related 
to the right hip pathology.  Pain more distal to the knee may be stemming from L4 
nerve root irritation, and given the MRI findings, I have referred her for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I recommend that Ms. Smith be referred 
into the MSK Central Intake program for hips and knees for further evaluation and 
hip surgical consultation.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

Thank you",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left leg and lower back pain.  The pain is 
chronic and exacerbated with any sustained positions or activities.   He describes left 
leg weakness and characterizes the leg symptoms as numbness with sharp pain.  
The leg pain can travel into the left foot.  He still attends physical therapy 
intermittently and has had chiropractic care in the past.  Treatments have not 
provided any significant relief.  Mr. Smith's health history includes having had a 
left L5-S1 discectomy in 2001.  His health history is otherwise unremarkable.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant motor deficit.  There 
is reduced sensation to sharp testing along the left L5 and S1 dermatomes.  There is 
a positive straight leg raise on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed September 28, 2021.  There is a cardinal finding of 
left L5-S1 disc herniation with moderate right and severe left foraminal stenosis.  
There is left more than right facet joint degenerative changes.  There is a broad 
based disc herniation at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing left leg radicular 
symptoms, likely from the lateral recess and foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 on the left.  
Given the ongoing pain and functional limitations, and lack of response to 
conservative care, I am referring him for a spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. 
Guha.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed exercises and he could 
follow-up with the advanced practice professional in the community for exercise 
review.  If back pain persists consideration could be given to referring Mr. Smith 
for medial branch/facet joint blocks of the lower lumbar spine at a pain clinic.

N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock and posterior thigh pain.  The 
onset was a few years ago and pain is worsening.  Physical therapy, chiropractic 
care, and osteopathy have not provided her with any significant relief.  She has had 
6 epidural injections and only 1 provided some relief transiently.  She applies heat at 
home, but is unable to get restful sleep.  She takes Advil, or Tylenol or Aleve prn.  
Her health in general is otherwise good.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes 
per day.
The physical examination findings are suggestive of right L5 radicular symptoms.  
There is no significant motor deficit.  A lumbar MRI was performed March 4, 2022 
and reveals a caudally directed disc extrusion at L4-5 with mild mass affect on the 
right L5 nerve root.
Given the ongoing and worsening leg dominant pain, the examination and MRI 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  
She should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

110,110,321,2022-05-02 00:00:00,Yes,No,No,0,1,157,3,1.0,0.0,0.0,It sounds like the patient's right leg pain is resulting from the spinal stenosis at L4-5 because he gives a picture of neurogenic claudication with his right leg.  His low back pain could be contributed from his degeneration at this level as well.  Not convinced the anterior left thigh pain is coming from the spinal stenosis but could be meralgia paresthetica.  However overall the patient is very severely affected by his right leg pain and low back pain.  As a result I did offer him the options of surgery versus not surgery.  With respect to surgery 1 could do a decompression at L4-5 either unilateral or bilateral and the possibility of adding a L4-5 instrumentation and fusion here could be done.  I did discuss the risk and benefits of both options and then in the end the patient and daughter agreed to do the decompression with instrumentation and fusion at L4-5.  I did also discussed with him conservative measures for example repeat physical therapy and pain clinic.  However they are very much in favor of more definitive treatments for with the surgery.  I explained to him the risk of the surgery include failure to improve symptoms worsening back pain with worsening pain weakness numbness in his leg or legs along with bowel bladder dysfunction.  There is risk of infection which is higher I believe because he is on prednisone and the other RA medication-as a result I asked the patient to contact his rheumatologist and give advice as to possibly stopping 1 or both of these medications.  From my search on rinivog this needs to be stopped 1 week before his surgery and I did inform the patient and the daughter of this.  There is risk of CSF leak as well as adjacent segment disease with the fusion and also failure of fusion and instrumentation.  The patient daughter are aware the risk and benefits and options and they have agreed to proceed with the operation.  I will wait to hear back from the patient regarding his 2 RA medications and stopping him.  We can probably do the surgery in the next few months.  I have asked the patient to go up for some dynamic lumbar spine films today.,,"Right - Negative

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain.  The onset was over a year 
ago as a result of a fall and pain is worsening.  The pain travels to the foot and toes.  
There is an increase in pain with walking and standing, and relief with lying down.  
There is left anterior thigh numbness.  Mr. Smith has undergone physical therapy 
without relief.  He cannot complete his ADLs.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed July 15, 2021 and reveals moderate to severe canal stenosis at 
L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is a Grade I 
spondylolisthesis.  There is a left L5-S1 disc protrusion.  There is moderate 
foraminal stenosis at L4-5 on the right.
In view of the ongoing leg dominant pain, impact on his quality of life, and MRI 
findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  
I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with self-directed exercises.

to have limited sitting, walking and standing tolerance.  He feels that his recovery 
has plateaued.  His health in general is good.
The physical examination findings reveal signs and symptoms of right S1 
radiculopathy.  A lumbar MRI was performed November 6, 2021 and reveals a large 
right L5-S1 paracentral disc herniation.
In view of the chronicity of symptoms and ongoing functional limitations, as well as 
examination and MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for a spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith. He is attending physical therapy weekly and should continue, and 
should continue with self-directed exercises.

Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of anterior left leg pain, and significant pain 
in the left buttock.  She is able to walk for up to 20 minutes, but has a standing 
tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  She has had physical therapy which only provided 
transient relief.  She has had several epidural injections which provides her relief for 
a few months.  She is having trouble getting restorative sleep due to her leg pain.  
Her health in general is otherwise good.  She does have essential hypertension.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There is no motor deficit or nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was performed 
September 5, 2021 and this reveals a cardinal finding of bilateral foraminal stenosis 
at L5-S1, left more than right.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing left L5 radicular symptoms.  
In view of the worsening of pain and functional limitations, as well as MRI findings, I

continuing to live with her symptoms, physical therapy and other conservative measures,
similarly multimodal medication management, injections and surgery.  Surgery was offered
in the form of an open left L2-3 microdiscectomy.  She would very much like to pursue
surgery as soon as possible.  The rationale for and the reasonably perceivable risks of
the procedure were explained which include, but are not limited to, those of general
anesthesia including death, stroke, paralysis and blindness, risks of bleeding and
infection and risks specific to this surgery, including nerve root or cauda equina injury
with temporary or permanent weakness, numbness or loss of bowel and bladder control,
durotomy with CSF leak, potentially requiring revision surgery, failure of symptomatic
improvement, wrong level surgery, degeneration of adjacent segments and reherniation.
She understood and provided informed consent to proceed.  Our office will arrange for a
preoperative Anesthesia appointment and subsequently secure an operative date for her at
the earliest opportunity.",no imaging,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left thigh and anterior leg pain.  She 
has also been experiencing left groin pain.  She relates that she cannot sleep on her 
left side.  Symptoms have been present for about 6 months and pain is worsening.  
Chiropractic care was helpful, but she can no longer afford to attend for treatment.  
Other than being a borderline diabetic, Ms. Smith health history is otherwise 
unremarkable.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L3 radiculopathy.  
There is a sluggish left patellar reflex and mild weakness of the left quadriceps.  
There is nerve root tension.  There is also reduced ranges of motion of the left hip, 
but x-rays performed today do not reveal any advanced degenerative changes.  A 
lumbar spine MRI was performed April 25, 2022 and the study reveals left L2-3 disc 
herniation with caudal migration and abutment of the left L3 nerve root.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing a left L3 radiculopathy 
from the identified disc herniation at L2-3.  Given the chronicity of symptoms and 
worsening of pain, as well as ongoing functional limitations including limited standing 
and walking tolerance, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. D. Guha.  I have recommended she follow-up with her physician for 
medication options, although she is taking Tylenol arthritis.  I query whether a

findings of a small right L4-L5 synovial cyst.  He is currently pain-free and therefore,
we discussed the range of options for his quality of life problems which include
continuing to live with the symptoms, multimodal medication management, physical therapy
and other similar conservative measures, injections, as well as a surgical decompression.
Certainly, these would be appropriate only if he again becomes symptomatic.  We did
discuss surgery in the form of left-sided minimally invasive approach for an over-the-top
decompression and resection of the right-sided synovial cyst at L4-L5.  We also discussed
options for injection for a right L4-L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection with
attempted cyst aspiration.  David is keen to pursue that route first and therefore, I
have referred him to a pain clinic for consideration of right L4-L5 transforaminal
epidural steroid injection as well as possible cyst aspiration only in the event that he
does become symptomatic.  The referral is in place and he will call the clinic should he
ultimately recur with the symptomatology.  I have not scheduled him for a routine

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a 1 year history of right leg pain.  Pain levels are variable.  
He has had physical therapy and acupuncture, and found a little relief with the 
acupuncture.  He is performing self-directed exercises.  His health history is 
unremarkable other than a history of asthma.  Mr. Smith is retired.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed November 12, 2021 and reveals a right L4-5 synovial 
cyst with compression of the right L5 nerve root.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing right L5 radicular symptoms.  
This is related to the right L4-5 synovial cyst.  Given the intermittent and persisting 
right leg pain, and imaging findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have recommended to him that he continue with 
self-directed exercises.

He does have some foraminal stenosis on the lumbar MRI which could be contributing to the quadriceps symptoms.  However given the deformity of the spine and treatment would be quite invasive.

for spine surgical consultation and an L2-5 canal enlargement/decompression was 
performed in December 2019.  The surgery did help with his leg symptoms and 
improved his walking tolerance.

Physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed September 24, 2021 and the cardinal finding is severe foraminal 
stenosis from a combination of degenerative changes at L4-5 and L5-S1 bilaterally.

follow-up with his spine surgeon, Dr. Smith.  I am making a referral.  At the same

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of bilateral buttock and leg pain.  The onset 
was a few years ago and his condition appears to be worsening.  He describes the 
leg pain as sharp and achy, increased with activity, and relieved with rest.  
Symptoms do not awaken.  His medical history is remarkable for rheumatoid 
arthritis.  He also reports osteoarthritis of his hips.  He is limited in his ability to 
perform chores at home.  He has limited walking and standing tolerance of less than 
five minutes.
The clinical presentation and history is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  
There is no significant neurological deficit on physical examination.  There are no 
long tract/pyramidal signs.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 19, 2021 and 
reveals a cardinal finding of severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 with small bilateral 
synovial cysts.  There is foraminal stenosis on the left.  Mr. Smith was shown the 
images for his education on his condition. 
In view of the leg dominant pain, the functional limitations and MRI findings, I am 
referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He says that 
he is not doing any exercises and he may wish to follow-up with the advanced 
practice professional in the community for exercise prescription/review.

complaint of buttock and leg pain, right more than left, and described the pain as a 
sharp sensation with reduced walking tolerance.  He also says that he has burning 
sensation in his feet at nighttime.  He relates his back troubles to a work related 
injury in 1987.  Mr. Smith has sought out physical therapy without relief.  He has also 
had a series of epidurals which helped at first for a short time, but eventually 
stopped working.  He says that he had blood work done a few weeks ago and that 
testing, including fasting glucose, was normal.  The clinical presentation was 
suggested of neurogenic claudication, but the history is somewhat atypical.  While 
there are increased symptoms with walking and standing, Mr. Smith also reported 
leg symptoms with lying down and at nighttime.  The physical examination did not 
reveal any significant neurological deficit, which would not be unusual with 
neurogenic claudication.  However, given his comorbidities, I was not convinced he is 
the best spine surgical candidate.  This is notwithstanding that there is moderate 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 from an MRI August 27, 2021.  I wanted to rule out 
possible vasculogenic component to his symptoms and requisitioned Doppler 
investigation of his lower extremities.
The Ankle-Brachial indices did not reveal any signs of PAD.  Given this and the 
ongoing leg dominant pain, as well as MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  In the interim, he 
should continue with activity to tolerance.

His claudicant symptoms are likely stemming from his internal iliac occlusion as per Dr. Tittley's opinion.  While I did not have the MRI images to review, the reports do not suggest any significant central stenosis that might be causing claudicant symptoms.  We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections ..  I have advised him to reach out to the pain clinic that he is already connected with, for consideration of multilevel medial branch blocks all followed potentially by RF ablation, as well as paraspinal muscle injections.  I have not booked him for routine follow-up at this time, however remain available should the need arise in the future. . .",,"In view that Mr. Smith's symptoms are resulting in functional limitations, including 
walking of only 5 to 10 minutes, and in consideration of the MRI images, I am 
referring him for a surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  There was reduced 
ranges of motion of the right hip on examination, and I requisitioned plain film 
radiographs of the hip.  These reveal only mild degenerative changes.  There is no 
identified need for follow-up with myself and I have encouraged Mr. Smith to 
continue with self-directed exercises.

started in the right leg and evolved to involve more left leg pain.  He continues to 
have some right leg pain.  The pains travel down the leg to the lateral foot.  The 
onset was in August 2020, and he did not find relief with acupuncture and physical 
therapy.  He currently attends at a pain clinic every 2 weeks for injections.  He 
relates a secondary complaint of diminished balance.  His medical history includes 
essential hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia.  Mr. Smith is retired.  He is limited 
in his ability to do chores at home due to reduced standing and walking tolerance of 
less than 5 minutes.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed June 30, 2021 and reveals severe bilateral lateral recess 
stenosis at L5-S1 and moderate to severe foraminal stenosis.  There is a right 
central to foraminal disc protrusion at L4-5.
In view of the significant limitation in walking and standing and the impact on his 
quality of life, the lack of response to conservative care, as well the MRI findings, I 
am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  It is also 
recommended that Mr. Smith be referred to a neurologist for further evaluation of his 
reported balance issues.  He should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

I also encouraged her to try aqua fit therapy which I find sometimes helpful with chronic pain.  She does have a back brace already.  I told her that I be happy to see her again in follow-up in approximately 6 months to gauge her progress.

the left than right.  The leg pain began about 8 months ago with a slip and fall, and 
pain is worsening.  The pain in the left leg travels as acral as the great toe, while in 
the right lower limb pain is only to the proximal leg.  She has had some physical 
therapy which she found helpful.  Epidural injection was not helpful.  There tends to 
be an increase in leg pain with prolonged sitting and walking.  Her medical history is 
remarkable for IDDM.  She smokes about a half pack of cigarettes per day.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
Smith is preserved in all myotomes.  A lumbar MRI was performed October 28, 
2021 and reveals severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally at L5-S1 and degenerative 
disc disease in the lower lumbar spine.  
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing bilateral L5 nerve root 
irritation from the severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  Given the chronicity of

128,128,356,2022-05-12 00:00:00,Yes,No,No,0,1,175,3,0.0,0.0,1.0,"This is a mechanical problem of structural insufficiency in her spine, she is quite simply so diffusely worn out with age-related degeneration that her spine is started to collapse into a degenerative deformity.  She mitigates the pain of that when she is doing her water exercises because the buoyancy of the water offloads her spine.  She is further mitigated that with her planking exercises building core strength to her lumbar extensors as they would be working even involuntarily to spasm and hold her deformity corrected.
 
I can certainly reassure her that I see no neurological or structural disaster in her foreseeable future and there is no hard indication for any prophylactic surgical care at this time.  I think she should work consistently at extending her planking tolerance that will likely increase her comfort significantly.  I have encouraged her to feel safe about the modest analgesia she is using I regularly have people using Tylenol at the maximum 3 g daily dose which is quite safe and that would be her best thing to trial if it works well she might be able to take her self off the Lyrica which from what I see in the scans does not have a hard indication anyway.  It is a medication prescribed for neuropathic pain and that is not her.
 
After extensive discussions with her and her husband attending including review of the x-rays and the scan I think I have been able to reassure her and we have not made any plans to see each other further",,"I initially saw Ms. Smith for consultation on May 12, 2022.  She reported back 
pain and this was related to degenerative changes, with a degenerative scoliosis.  
The physical examination did not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
are no signs of radiculopathy , myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy.  MRI of the 
lumbar spine March 8, 2022 reveals advanced facet osteoarthritis and left convex 
scoliosis.  I recommended that she continue with Aquatherapy and chiropractic care.  
I also recommended blood work up.
Ms. Smith reports on follow-up that she has ongoing lower back pain.  She has 
had physical therapy, chiropractic care and exercises.  She is doing Aquatherapy 
which she has found helpful.  She has also attended at a pain clinic.  Medications 
include: Lyrica 125 mg qam, 150 mg qhs; Tylenol arthritis 1 qhs or prn; and Baclofen 
qhs.
My clinical impression remains the same.  Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back 
pain related to the degenerative scoliosis.  The conservative measures have not 
provided her the kind of relief she wishes, and she has requested a surgical 
consultation.  I think that this is reasonable and I have referred her to Dr. Smith, 
orthopaedic spine surgeon.  She can continue with the more conservative measures 
she has undergone if it provides relief.

management.  Signed the consent form today for L4-L5 decompression with cyst removal.
This is a more conservative approach and will avoid a fusion operation.  Given the
possible benefits with limited loss of range of motion and lack of hardware, we will
proceed with this more conservative approach.  She understood the risk of bleeding,
injury to surrounding structures, late failure of this and recurrence of the cyst
requiring revision surgery.  She also understood the risk of anesthetic including but not
limited to stroke, DVT, PE, or even death.  She signed the consent form today.  Our
office will be in touch with her with regards to booking the appointment.",,"Ms. Quick presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain to the lateral foot.  
The onset was about 1 year ago and pain is worsening.  She has not been able to 
return to work since November.  She is able to void her bladder and there is no 
perineal numbness.  Pain awakens her and she does not get restorative sleep.  Her 
medical history is remarkable for Smith.  She is on anticoagulant medication.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
There is corresponding on lumbar MRI from October 2021 which reveals a left L4-5 
synovial cyst compromising the left lateral recess.
Given the lack of response to conservative management, the leg dominance of the 
pain, functional limitations, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Ms. Quick for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Fortunately, Dr. Smith 
was in the clinic today and agreed to see Ms. Quick today.  Further comment is

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include  continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections  And surgery  . We mutually agreed to pursue surgery given her debilitation and her quality of life, and surgery was offered in the form of an L2-5 decompression and posterolateral instrumented fusion. The rationale for the procedure and reasonably forseeable risks were explained, which include but are not limited to, those of general anesthesia, including death, stroke, paralysis and blindness, risks of bleeding and infection potentially requiring revision surgery, and risks specific to this procedure, including  cauda equina  or nerve root injury with temporary or permanent weakness, numbness and/or loss of bowel/bladder control, durotomy with CSF leak potentially requiring revision surgery, failure of symptomatic improvement,  hardware malposition with potential for neurovascular injury and need for revision surgery, hardware failure, pseudarthrosis,  , index or adjacent segment degeneration including disc reherniation, wrong level surgery.  Elizabeth  asked appropriate questions and provided informed consent. Our office will arrange for an appointment with the pre-operative Anesthesia clinic, and subsequently arrange an operative date.

That is a moderate operation with the generally good outcome probability in my practice but for her, given the cardiac history I think it should be done on an inpatient basis so we can support her perioperatively.  Also, given the cardiac history I do want her to see a screening cardiologist before any surgery was done.
 
We spent quite some time together here at the clinic today as I explained the problem shoulder the scans and offered the potential surgical solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues, although also the alternative of ongoing observational management way do not expect things are ever going to change much for her and will only tend to slowly deteriorate.
 
She is very cautiously interested in the surgical care alternative but obviously not ready to make a decision today so I have asked her to keep a log of her surgical symptoms and decision diary.  I will have my office schedule her back in 6 weeks time for discussions and decision making at that point.","surgical candidate, but unsure at this time, will follow up in 6 months","Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock pain and right leg numbness and 
weakness.  The onset was in May 2021 with lifting.   She has limited walking and 
standing tolerance, but with the aid of a walker she can walker further.  She is able 
to get restorative sleep.  Ms. Smith has not had any physical therapies recently, but 
does attend at a pain clinic weekly and injections provide relief for a few days.  Her 
medical history is remarkable for having suffered a myocardial infarction and a 
history of essential hypertension.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L4-5 radiculopathy.  
A lumbar MRI performed October 27, 2021 reveals severe multilevel degenerative 
disc and fact joint changes.  There is multilevel lateral recess and foraminal stenosis 
at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1.  There is a degenerative right convex scoliosis.  On 
personal review there is also fairly marked right L5-S1 foraminal stenosis.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she 
should continue with self-directed exercises.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left more than right leg paresthesia.  There 
is a burning sensation in the left buttock and proximal posterior thigh.  The onset 
was a couple of years ago and symptoms have not improved despite a course of 
physical therapy.  He describes some weakness in his right leg.  His general medical 
history is unremarkable other than hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
There is nerve root tension on the left.  A lumbar MRI was performed October 22, 
2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1, and bilateral 
recess stenosis at L4-5.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain and left leg pain.  The 
onset was several years ago and he has not experienced any significant 
improvement.  He is not doing much in the way of exercises.  His medical history is 
only remarkable for hypothyroidism, hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L4 and S1 
radiculopathy.  The back pain is Smith and mechanical.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed May 16, 2022 and reveals cardinal findings of facet arthropathy at L5-S1 
with lateral recess stenosis left more than right, and left L4-5 foraminal stenosis.
Given the ongoing left leg pain and lack of improvement, as well as ongoing 
functional limitations and MRI results, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  For the back pain, I have referred Mr. Smith to 
a pain clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet joint blocks.  I have encouraged 
him to continue with self-directed exercises.

N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left leg pain.  The onset was 
about 8 years ago and symptoms are worsening.  Her medical history is 
unremarkable.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant motor deficit.  There 
are left leg radicular symptoms and diminished sensation over the left L5 
dermatome, suggestive of left L5 nerve root involvement.  This is likely related to 
severe foraminal and lateral recess stenosis noted on MRI at the left L4-5 level.  On 
physical examination there are decreased range of motion of the hips, but plain film 
radiographs today only reveal mild degenerative changes.
At this time, in view of the persisting left leg pain and MRI findings, and affect that 
pain is having on her functioning, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Pending this consultation, she may wish to trial a 6 
week program of physical therapy to attempt to improve the lower back pain.  Ms. 
Smith should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left more than right lower back pain.  The 
onset was in March 2020 and he attributes it to a viral infection which affected other 
body areas.  He says that pain is worsening.  He has found transient relief with 
physical therapy and chiropractic care, and he continues with self-directed exercises.  
He is able to obtain restorative sleep.  Mr. Smith has been attending with Dr. Smith for injections (sounds like epidurals?) which he says provides him relief for a 
few weeks.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There are no nerve root tension signs.  Hip ranges of motion are good with no signs 
of internal derangement.  Mr. Smith has a marked left antalgia and anterior list of his 
torso.  This is related to a degenerative lumbar scoliosis.  On review of the MRI from 
April 2021 there is some lateral listhesis and the most prominent changes are in the 
lower lumbar spine.
Mr. Smith presents in some physical distress and cannot walk without the aid of a 
walker.  His pain levels can be intense and he relates that the back condition is 
affecting his quality of life.  Notwithstanding that his pain is back dominant and the 
examination findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. 
Smith.  He should continue with physical therapies.  Dr. Smith may wish to 
consider medial branch/facet joint blocks.

I discussed with him putting on the add board list versus getting the surgery done next

be reasonable to do next week in my operating room.
 
He elected to go in my scheduled time.  He will let us know if symptoms worsen.  He will
come to the Emergency Department if he develops worsening symptoms.
 
I explained the procedure to him.  Expected outcome being improvement of his pain and
stabilization of his sphincter function.
 
I discussed risks including CSF leak, infection, neurologic injury resulting in
paraplegia, bowel or bladder dysfunction, vascular injury, visceral injury, revision
surgery, wrong level surgery, risk of anesthesia including death, paralysis, blindness,
stroke, heart attack.
 
All questions answered.  He wished to proceed.",,"I initially saw Mr. Smith on January 25, 2022 when he was reporting right leg and 
lower back pain.  He described a burning sensation at the anterior leg and pain 
through the right hemipelvis.  There The onset of symptoms was more than 1 year 
ago and pain was worsening.  His health history includes diabetes and essential 
hypertension.  The physical examination findings were commensurate with right L4/5 
radiculopathy.  There was some reduction of internal rotation of the right hip, but 
x-rays only reveal mild degeneration.  I recommended MRI of the lumbar spine and 
Mr. Smith reported to me that he already had one scheduled.
Mr. Smith says that his symptoms remain the same, predominantly in the right leg.  
He has attended at a pain clinic and injection provided him with relief for about a 
week.  Overall, he has not experienced any significant improvement.  He says that 
his standing and walking tolerance is only about 5 minutes.
The MRI was performed February 16, 2022 and reveals a cardinal findings of severe 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 from a combination of degenerative changes, and right 
lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 which may be a primary source of his pain.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, the disabling nature of his pain, the physical 
examination findings and MRI results, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical

right leg in an L5 distribution.  Her symptoms are not otherwise consistent with
neurogenic claudication as she reports that her back dominant pain is present, regardless
of position with no real relief with forward flexion. She is not keen on surgical
intervention.  Given these findings, we had a
long discussion today and mutually agreed that the next reasonable step would be to
proceed with injections, specifically a right transforaminal epidural steroid injection
for a nerve root block at L5-S1 as well as multilevel facet blocks.  In the future, a
midline epidural injection may also be considered if her symptoms progressed to more of a
claudication picture. The patient would like to see a pain clinic closer to home and
therefore I would ask that her family physician refer her to a pain clinic that is most
accessible to her with the shortest wait time.  I have not booked her for a followup at
this time; however, remain available should there be any concerns in the future.
 ",,"Right - Negative
No pain produced with either flexion or extension
slump test positive on right
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right leg pain which can travel as distal 
as the toes.  She reports having had an epidural injection which helped and is 
scheduled for another February 15, 2021.  She has tried physical therapy without 
relief.  Overall, her pain seems to be worsening.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is corresponding finding on MRI of severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 on the 
right, and moderate to severe canal stenosis at L3-4.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, functional limitations and MRI findings, I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have 
encouraged her to continue with self-directed exercises.  Weight loss has been 
encouraged.

I brought up the scan and showed it to the patient explaining the nature of the problem
and what would be involved in the surgical care solution.  He would need aggressive
subtraction of all loose posterior elements below L2 and correspondingly instrumented
stabilization L2 to pelvis.  That is certainly a major operation which will be done on an
inpatient basis, might need some transfusion and keep him in the place for at least a
week or so.
 
It is a very good operation to do and that he is looking at a very high probability of
significant relief of this neuro claudicant symptoms and improved functional tolerance.
 
It turns out the man's absolutely terrified of instrumented spine surgery, this allegedly
because of the unsatisfactory experience of his mother in the hands of a Toronto surgeon
8 years ago.  I have no details there.
 
This man's spine is already flat backed in the MRI and clinically unstable as we assess
him, I think it would be a travesty to look at trying to get him decompressed without
stabilizing his spine, ideally to reconstitute some element of lumbar lordosis and
improve his sagittal plane imbalance indicators.  I would likely do that in this case
with the simple expedience of transosseous screws to elevate and interfere with his
anterior column because his neural foraminal heights are good.  I do not think he needs
formal diskectomies and interbody implants.
 
We spent a long time discussing pros and cons and the issues around his anxiety, I can
flat out tell him that if I put him onto the surgical list today, he is likely not
looking at having anything done for at least a year, if not 2.  Even that did not sway
him from his obvious anxiety and so eventually we reached a point where we decided not to
make any surgical plans.  I gave him my office contact information, referred him to my
patient education website and asked him to contact the office when and if he might decide
he wants to go ahead to surgery, so we can come back in and talk it through again.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of bilateral leg pain.  The left leg pain is 
chronic, while the right leg pain has been present for about a year.  He has limited 
standing and walking tolerance.  He describes some urinary urgency, but there is no 
retention and there is no perineal numbness.
The history and physical examination is consistent with neurogenic claudication, 
bilateral L5 radiculopathy and right L4 radiculopathy.  The lumbar MRI was 
performed January 4, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5, severe 
right foraminal stenosis at the same level, and severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at

I told her that the surgery designed to help her back pain and leg symptoms and that usually the leg symptoms are the more likely to improve.  Course there is no guarantees with the surgery.  I explained to her that there is a reasonable chance that she will notice symptomatic improvement.  The risk include the risk of nonimprovement of any symptoms, worsening pain weakness numbness in her leg or legs or back pain.  I explained to her the risk of nonfusion or failure of instrumentation as well as adjacent segment disease.  There is a risk of anesthetic, CSF leak, infection.  The patient is aware of the risk and benefits and options and would like to proceed with the surgery sometime early in the new year.  I will get dynamic films the patient today.",,"Ms. Smith was initially seen February 4, 2022 at which time she was reporting 
bilateral leg pain, right more than left.  The onset was about 2 years ago and 
symptoms were worsening.  Physical therapy and chiropractic care were not helpful.  
Her health in general is otherwise unremarkable.  She has essential hypertension 
and bradycardia.  She reports a history of whitening of her fingers with exposure to 
cold.  
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  There was 
no significant motor deficit on examination.  A lumbar MRI was performed in May 
2020 which reveals moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at L3-4.  There is also 
a left synovial cyst at the same level.  I felt that she was likely a surgical candidate, 
but that updated lumbar MRI was required first.
Today Ms. Smith says that her leg pain has increased and her walking tolerance is 
only about 20 minutes.  Pain can also awaken her.  The lumbar MRI was performed 
May 4, 2022 and reveals moderate to severe L3-4 canal stenosis, and mild to 
moderate canal stenosis at L4-5.  There is a synovial cyst on the left.
My clinical impression remains the same.  Her presentation is commensurate with 
neurogenic claudication.  Given the ongoing functional limitations, the worsening of 
leg dominant pain, and MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with 
self-directed flexion based exercises.

of lumbar canal stenosis and neural foraminal stenosis because the main problem of the
patient is back pain, we do not believe that relieving the pinching of those nerves would
relieve her symptoms.  Examination as well revealed tenderness around the sacroiliac
joints on deep palpation, so we do not recommend any surgical intervention because any
surgical intervention would be of a major type and the risks overweigh any benefits
expected from it.  We advised the patient to follow with her pain specialist and to
consider nerve block at the levels of L2-L3 and possibly sacroiliac joint injection.",,"Given the ongoing back and buttock pain, and lack of response to conservative 
therapies, as well as imaging findings, I feel that it is reasonable that we seek a 
spine surgical consultation.  Given her age I do not feel that she is the most optimal 
surgical candidate, but am nevertheless referring Ms. Smith to Dr. Smith 
for his expert opinion.  Ms. Smith says that she is scheduled to return for a 
second epidural injection and this may provide her similar relief as the first.  She 
should be performing activities to tolerance.

experiencing approximate 15-month history of sciatic pain tracking along the S1
dermatome.  MRI and x-ray reports support a S1 radiculopathy.  At this time, we discussed
with the patient that he has used many of the nonoperative managements available to
little or no effect and we understand that this is clearly affecting his day-to-day
function and quality of life.  We explained to the patient that he can continue with
nonoperative management; however, we do believe that the pain he is experiencing,
particularly in his leg could be resolved with operative management.  We explained to the
patient the process of surgery known as a microdiscectomy.  We explained to the patient
the risks and benefits associated with the surgery including, but not limited to 20% disc
reoccurrence at the level that we are fixing or reoccurrence at a different disc, fluid
leak, infection and nerve damage.  We also explained that since the patient will be under
anesthesia that there are risks associated with this including but not limited to stroke,
heart attack or blindness.  The patient was understanding and agreeable to the plan.  We
consented the patient in clinic today on May 13.  All the patient's questions were
answered to his satisfaction.  We informed the patient that should he have any questions
in the interim to not hesitate to reach out to our clinic.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The pain 
travels as distal as the lateral ankle, and there is numbness at the plantar aspect of 
his foot.  The onset was about 13 months ago.  While he has experienced some 
improvement from the initial intensity, his recovery has plateaued.  The pregabalin 
that has been prescribed is helping to manage his pain. Physical therapy, chiropractic 
care and epidural injection were not helpful.  His health in general is unremarkable.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There is some mild weakness of the left hamstrings.  There are nerve root tension 
signs on the left.  MRI of the lumbar spine was performed May 15, 2021 and reveals 
a left L5-S1 disc herniation with impingement and displacement of the left S1 nerve 
root and possible impingement of the exiting L5 nerve.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing a left S1 radiculopathy.  Given 
the lack of response to conservative measures, examination and MRI findings, I am 
referring him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have 
recommended to him that he continue with self-directed exercises.

the leg pain as an ache or stabbing sensation and there is a lot of pain in the left 
foot.  She has to sleep sitting in a chair.  She does find chiropractic care does 
provide some relief and she attends weekly.  She is only able to do a few gentle 
exercises.  She is taking Gabapentin and Advil for pain relief.
The physical examination findings and distribution of pain is commensurate with left 
S1 radiculopathy.  There is nerve root tension on the left.  There is diminished 
sensation along the left S1 dermatome. There is no significant motor deficit. A 
lumbar MRI was performed December 6, 2021 reveals an L5-S1 disc protrusion with 
abutment of the S1 nerves.

Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The onset was in 
the autumn of 2019 and she says that she has not experienced any significant 
improvement.  She has a little weakness in the left calf.  She did not respond to a 
course of physical therapy and exercises are not helping.  She is not currently taking 
any pain relieving medications.  Her medical history includes anxiety and depression, 
but is otherwise unremarkable.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with a left S1 radiculopathy.  
There is diminished left patellar reflex and positive straight leg raise on the left.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed March 5, 2020 and reveals a left postero-lateral disc 
herniation at L5-S1 with severe left lateral recess stenosis and mass affect of the left 
S1 nerve root.
Given the persistent and unremitting left leg pain, the examination findings and MRI 
results, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  
I have also requisitioned an updated MRI of the lumbar spine.  She should be 
continuing with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain and in December 2021 
developed right foot drop.  He says that he has had a few falls.  His medical history 
is remarkable for hypertension, diabetes, severe depression and PTSD.  He has been 
on long term disability for 3 years.  He has limited sitting and walking tolerance of 5 
to 10 minutes.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is weakness of right foot dorsiflexion and EHL.  A lumbar MRI performed 
February 24, 2022 reveals severe right foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and right L4-5 
disc protrusion and compromise of the right lateral recess.
Given the persisting and debilitating right leg pain and weakness, as well as MRI, I 
am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He 
should be continuing with activity to tolerance and self-directed exercises.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was in 
March 2021 and symptoms are worsening.  He has attended for massage, traction, 
physical therapy and chiropractic care without relief.  He has had a few injections 
(described epidural and facet joint block) without relief.  Pain sometimes disturbs his 
sleep.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is no nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was performed July 9, 2021 in Buffalo and 
this reveals a broad-based disc protrusion at L4-5 and L5-S1 without neural 
compression.  There is moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 bilaterally.
Given the back dominance of his pain, Mr. Smith may not be the best surgical 
candidate.  However, he has almost exhausted conservative options and the pain 
remains debilitating.  There are degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.  
Given this, and after exploring for his expectations, we agreed on a surgical 
consultation.  I am referring Mr. Smith to Dr. Smith for his opinion.  At the 
same time, I am referring Mr. Smith to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for 
consideration of medial branch blocks.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith to 
follow-up with his physician for pain control options.  I query whether something like 
Tramadol may proffer him some relief.  He should continue with self-directed 
exercises.

Her pain is debilitating, and though her physical examination is reassuring and that it does not demonstrate any motor or sensory deficits, she does have limited hip flexion and her pain is worse on spine flexion reinforcing the idea that her central disc protrusions are likely a source of pain. Nevertheless, she has an MRI which does show central disc protrusions but no neural compromise is seen. The patient has not tried any injections which may significantly help relieve her pain. At this point in time surgery would not be indicated since there is no neural compromise and obvious source to explain her pain. It was recommended that as part of both therapeutic planning and diagnostic work-up the patient should undergo steroid injections. Importantly, the steroid injections should be x-ray guided, transforaminal epidural injections, and be performed in a staged fashion for the right L5-S1 as well as the right L4-L5 spinal nerve roots. If her pain improves significantly and this lasts for several weeks to months, steroid injections would be recommended as a main course of treatment without subjecting the patient to the risks of surgery. If her pain does improve but this only lasts for a very short period of time or if her pain does not improve, then we would want to have a repeat MRI to evaluate for any progression and possibly consider surgery if there is sufficient evidence to suggest that a surgical intervention would help alleviate her symptoms -- this is not currently the case.

findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Ms. Smith should be continuing with self-directed flexion based exercises.

Mr. Smith presents with buttock and bilateral leg pain, characterized as numbness 
and weakness.  He has limited walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes, and 
standing of 5 to 10 minutes.  Symptoms are alleviated with sitting, but prolonged 
sitting can exacerbate pain.  There is no urinary retention and no perineal 
numbness.  His medical history is unremarkable except for hypertension.
The physical examination findings do not reveal signs of radiculopathy, myelopathy 
or peripheral neuropathy.  There is no nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed October 31, 2021 and reveals multilevel acquired spinal stenosis at L2-3, 
L3-4 and L4-5.  The worst level is L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication.  
Given the multilevel spinal canal stenosis and functional limitations, I am referring 
him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Mr. Smith should continue 
with self-directed exercises and aquatherapy may help facilitate the performance of 
exercises.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock and leg pain.  The onset was 
about 1 year ago, and while he does report some improvement, he indicates his 
recovery has plateaued.  There is continued pain at night and he is significant 
impeded in his walking tolerance.  He has had non-guided injections without relief.  
His medical history includes diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression and 
anxiety.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  A 
lumbar MRI reveals corresponding L4-5 disc protrusion, right lateral recess stenosis 
and impingement of the right L5 nerve root.
Given the ongoing leg dominant and persisting functional limitations, as well as

consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have encouraged him to continue with activities to 
tolerance.

tender left Smith
Ms. Rate presents with a complaint of burning pain at the left anterior thigh and 
knee.  The onset was about a year ago and pain is worsening.  Physical therapy, 
chiropractic care, and injections have not provided relief.  She reports having limited 
walking and standing tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  Her medical history includes 
fibromyalgia, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and hypothyroidism.
The physical examination reveals findings commensurate with left L3, 4 
radiculopathy.  There is weakness of the left quadriceps.  There is nerve root 
tension.  There is diminished sensation along the left L3 dermatome.  A lumbar MRI 
was performed September 22, 2020 and reveals a cardinal finding of severe canal 
and lateral foraminal stenosis on the left at L3-4.  There is mild anterolisthesis of L2 
on 3, 3 on 4, and 4 on L5.
In view of the imaging findings and lack of improvement with conservative 
management, as well as examination findings, but notwithstanding her age, I am 
referring Ms. Rate for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have also 
recommended that she follow-up with her physician regarding medication options.  
She indicates having tried Smith in the past, but I am not certain if Gabapentin 
was tried.  Consideration could be given to referring her for an epidural injection as 
this may provide her with some relief.  I have requisitioned an updated MRI.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left leg pain.  The onset was recent over the 
last week or so, and prior to that he was doing well, but with some right leg pain.  I 
saw him 2020 at which time he had left leg pain.  I diagnosed left L5 radiculopathy 
and he had a subsequent L4-5 discectomy in February 2021.  
Currently, the physical examination findings are similar to when I last saw him.  
There are findings consistent with left L5 radiculopathy. There is no report of urinary 
retention or saddle anesthesia. Mr. Smith says that he has a lumbar MRI scheduled 
for October 1, 2022.  Given his physical distress today, I have also put in a requisition 
here at HGH and asked that the MRI be expedited.  I recommended that he follow-up 
with his physician about possible prescription for lyrica or gabapentin.  An epidural 
injection could also be considered.  I will be following up with Mr. Smith after the 
MRI.

Radiographically, he has multiple degenerative changes in his lumbar spine with the most significant stenosis at the L4-5 and the L5-S1 levels. A lengthy discussion was had with the patient and their family about the risks and benefits of surgery as well as other alternative treatment option. Specifically, the risks associated with surgery discussed included but were not limited to infection (both early and late), bleeding, VTE, damage to local structures, dural tear, paralysis or paresis, as well as risk to anesthetic and surgery that may lead to PE, MI, stroke or even death. After understanding these risks and benefits, and verbalizing that understanding, the consent form for L4-5 and L5-S1 posterior decompression was signed.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of leg paresthesia and heaviness.  He has to 
use a walker to ambulate.  His walking and standing tolerance is less than 5 minutes.  
Mr. Smith's medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  There is no 
significant neurological deficit.  A lumbar MRI was performed May 28, 2022 which 
reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1 from a combination of 
degenerative changes.
In view of the significant functional difficulties at this point and diminished quality of 
life, the leg dominance to the symptoms and the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. 
Fabbro for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should 
continue with self-directed, flexion-based exercises.

tender lumbo-sacral junction
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of lower back pain and secondarily right 
leg pain.  The onset was a few years ago and pain is worsening.  She reports that 
she attended for chiropractic care a couple of years ago which helped a little.  More 
recently she has had medial branch blocks which did not help.  Exercises are not 
helping.  She states that her walking tolerance is only 5 to 10 minutes and pain is 
affecting her quality of life.  She has non-restorative sleep due to pain.  Ms. Smith's 
health history is unremarkable.  She does have a history of osteoporosis.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There are no motor deficits.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 23, 2021 and 
reveals a Grade I spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 with significant facet degeneration and 
foraminal stenosis bilaterally.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing mechanical (lumbo-sacral) 
lower back pain and likely irritation of the right L5 nerve root that is causing the leg 
pain.  Given her failure to adequately respond to more conservative measures, 
involving chiropractic care and facet joint/medial branch blocks, as well as the 
worsening pain and MRI findings, I think it reasonable that we obtain a surgical 
opinion as to whether she may be a candidate for a lumbo-sacral fusion.  I am 
referring Ms. Smith to Dr. D. Guha for his expert opinion.  In the interim, Ms. Smith 
should continue with self-directed exercises to maintain her current levels of mobility 
and activity.

We mutually agreed to pursue ongoing conservative management considering that she has improved and continues to be in a very livable state without any debilitating pain.  I have not booked her for routine follow-up.  Should there be a significant recurrence of any radicular pain in the future she would likely require an updated MRI from her family physician. . ",,"Ms. Smith presents today with a complaint of left more than right lower back pain, 
and left leg numbness.  The onset of symptoms was a few years ago and pain 
seems to be worsening.  The back pain is characterized as an achiness.  Ms. Smith 
does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal 
numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She has tried physical therapy without relief, and 
she sees her chiropractor periodically for treatment which is helpful.  Ms. Smith 
says that she has not had any injections.  Her health in general is reportedly good.  
She is not gainfully employed and is able to manage chores at home.
The physical examination findings reveals that she walks with a normal gait.  There 
is no antalgia.  There is an increase in back pain with lumbar flexion.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is 5/5 L2 to S1, except 
for mild (4+/5) weakness of the left EHL.  Sensation is also mild reduced on the left 
L5 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is no 
clonus/spasticity or other long tract signs. Hoffman's sign is absent and upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Supine straight leg raising did not create neural tension, but slump 
test was positive on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 13, 2020.  The cardinal finding is left L4-5 
disc protrusion with compromise of the left L5 nerve root and degenerative disc 
disease at L5-S1 which is fairly advanced.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing discogenic lower back pain 
and there are some residual signs of right L5 radiculopathy.  She still has some 
paresthesia in the left leg.  At this point, given the back dominance to her pain, she 
may not be the best surgical candidate, but given her concerns about becoming 
completely disabled and the degenerative changes noted in the lower lumbar spine, I 
feel it is appropriate that we seek spine surgical consultation.  I am referring Ms. 
Smith for consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I also recommend that her physician 
consider referring her to a pain clinic for epidural injection which may proffer her 
some relief.  She does not drive, therefore I defer to her physician to refer her 
somewhere in Burlington.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises.  She could trial a back support belt for when she is 
performing more physically demanding activities.  Ms. Smith has found some 
benefit from chiropractic care and she can continue with this if she continues to find 
benefit.

and heaviness, with numbness at the left lateral foot.  He has a left foot drop.  The 
onset of symptoms was in 2017 and his symptoms and functional decline are 
worsening.  He has limited walking and standing of less than five minutes.  Sitting is 
unrestricted.  Mr. Smith is able to bike.  His medical history reveals that he's otherwise 
healthy.  He has had a prior left hamstring tear and weakness.
The physical examination reveals weakness of left ankle dorsiflexion and EHL.  The 
right patellar reflex is sluggish compared to the left.  There is reduced sensation 
along the left L5 and S1 dermatomes.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.   There is no spasticity or clonus.  There 
are no long tract signs.
Clinical findings reveal neurogenic claudication and left L5 radiculopathy. A lumbar 
MRI was performed in January 2022 at GNMI and reveals a cardinal finding of severe 
spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is 
moderate foraminal stenosis bilaterally.
At this time, given the functional decline and limited walking tolerance, as well as 
examination and MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should be performing activities to tolerance.

Pain produced with Extension
N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock, leg and foot pain.  The 
onset was in November 2021 and he has not experienced improvement despite 
physical therapies and chiropractic care.  The pain has affected his quality of life.  He 
was previously working modified duties, but has not been able to work since May 18, 
2022.  
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is weakness of the right EHL.  There is nerve root tension on the right.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  A lumbar MRI was performed 
February 22, 2022 reveals a large right L4-5 disc herniation with compromise of the 
right lateral recess.
Given the ongoing debilitating right leg pain, the lack of response to conservative 
care, the MRI and examination results, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue with 
activity to tolerance.

complex with displacement of the right L3 nerve root.  There is a calcified disc at 
L1-2 with moderate to severe canal stenosis.  The most clinically relevant finding in 
my opinion is the foraminal disc extrusion at L4-5.  Ms. Smith has extensive 
degenerative disc and facet joint degeneration and this is contributory to her history 
of chronic lower back pain.
In view of the debilitating and worsening right leg pain, the lack of improvement, 
examination findings and MRI results, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with activities to 
tolerance.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

176,176,443,2022-06-14 00:00:00,Yes,No,No,0,1,208,4,1.0,0.0,0.0,"Recent MRI shows the relatively preserved central spinal canal of the oligotrophic spine instability patient with considerable scattered neuroforaminal stenosis particularly in the concavities of her deformity. The worst of her deformity and stenosis brackets the L2-4 levels.  The L3 and L4 nerve roots got would compress their run to the thighs and shin so the problem fits the complaint and I think we can helper surgically by going to those levels for neuroforaminal decompressions, instrumented stabilization and realignment of the worst of her deformity.  That some moderate operation that in somebody with normal lungs could be easily and safely accomplished on an overnight stay basis, given her problem asthma I recognize some probability we may not be able to operate on her at all when she is prone we may not be able to ventilator and that is a big problem.  There is also risk of ventilatory pneumothorax that I discussed with her today.  This would be a limited operation talking targeting the worst of her pathoanatomy and the most symptomatic recognizing some probability we might need to do more above or below somewhere down the line, particularly as I dictate this note at the end of the clinic today I am thinking that some modest decompressions proximal might be helpful. Today with her husband attending of explained the problem, showed her the x-rays and scans and offered the great potential benefit to be had from surgery here with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues.  She is almost tearfully happy to hear that might be a solution to her problem of the line and gave me consent accordingly.  Sadly I must remind all parties concerned it will routinely take me somewhere between 1 and 2 years to bring a cold elective case to the operating room at best of times, given the access limitations of our healthcare system.  Certainly if things are getting worse in the interim she can call my office to let us know and I will do what I can to jump to nightly as needed.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  The leg 
pain is characterized as a burning sensation, more right leg than left.   The pain is 
constant with no particular exacerbating or relieving factors recalled.  The pain has 
been present for several years and she relates that her pain is worsening and 
disrupting her sleep.  She has had epidural injections without relief.  Ms. 
Smith has not had any recent physical therapy.  Her general medical history 
is unremarkable.  She is struggling to complete chores at home and has limited 
walking and standing tolerance of less than 5 minutes.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant motor deficit or 
weakness.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  There are no long tract signs.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  A lumbar MRI was performed 
January 22, 2022 and reveals degenerative changes and right convex scoliosis.  
There is moderate canal and left foraminal stenosis at L3-4 and mild canal recess 
stenosis at L4-5.  There is significant left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 on personal 
review of images.
Ms. Smith clinical presentation is somewhat atypical for neurogenic 
claudication.  She has a degenerative lumbar spine with scoliosis which is 
contributing to the lower back pain.  There is stenosis which is likely causing her 
lower extremity pain.  At this point in time, given the chronicity of symptoms, 
worsening of pain and impact on her quality of life, examination and imaging 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim she should be continuing with activities to tolerance.

I think this is a central sagittal plane malalignment problem compensated by her myofascial spasm but that is giving her pain and a problem.  If we can realign that lumbosacral motion segment back towards normal we will offload the paraspinal musculature and that brings a good probability of significant if not definitive pain relief.  There are a number of technical options for isolated anterior column reconstruction/realignment, in my practice standard is a PLIF reconstruction easily accomplished on an overnight stay basis with generally good outcomes. Today have explained the problem to Ms. Lester, reassured her there is no neurologic catastrophe in her pending future and offered the potential great benefit to be had from surgery which would be entirely elective here so she will likely be waiting a good year or 2 for access to it in our climate of limited care access.  She is cautiously interested in the care plan and gave me consent accordingly.  I will look forward to helping her out down the line when I can.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and leg pain, and also 
interscapular pain.  The symptoms have been present for years but are worsening.  
She is having difficulty completing her work.  She has limited standing and walking 
tolerance of 5 to 10 minutes. She reports that her balance is declining. Ms. Smith 
has had physical therapy without relief.  Her general medical history is 
unremarkable.  She is a non-smoker.
The physical examination reveals that she is neurologically intact with no signs of 
radiculopathy or florid myelopathy. She is hyper reflexic at the patellae and has a 
positive Smith test.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  In the upper limbs 
reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no spasticity or clonus in the 
upper or lower limbs.  A cervical and thoracic MRI was performed January 12, 2022.  
The most concerning finding is at T6-7.  There is a disc protrusion and advanced 
cord compression, but with no signs of signal change.  There is moderate spinal 
canal stenosis at C5-6.
Ms. Smith is reasonably functional at this time and is still able to work, but is 
reporting balance difficulties.  There are subtle signs of myelopathy and findings on 
MRI of cord compression at T6-7.  Given this, I think it appropriate that we seek a 
spine surgical opinion.  I am referring Ms. Smith for consultation with Dr. Smith (I had the opportunity to review the MRI images with Dr. Smith today).  I 
have also requisitioned a thoracic CT scan as there is concern as to whether the 
T6-7 disc is calcified.  For her lower back pain Ms. Smith could consider some 
spinal mobilization to the lumbar spine with a manually trained physical therapist or 
chiropractor.  Any manual treatment directed at the mid thoracic spine should be 
avoided.  Ms. Smith should continue with activity to tolerance.

I think , looking at the anatomy of his MRI, he would need old-style access laminectomies at L3 and L4 with bracketng facetectomies L2-3, L3-4 and L4-5 for thorough decompression there. All that will require concomitant instrumented stabilization L2 to L5. Proximally, some modest neural foraminal decompression L1-2 would do the job. THis is a moderate operation whcih would require at least a short in-patient hospita stay. With his daughter attending, I have explained the problem and proposed surgical solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent time frame issues. I have been very honest about my personal concerns to his condition. and that this should be done sooner rather than later. He is cautiously interested in the surgical alternative, and gave me consent accordingly. I am going to put in for a referral to Jason Ohayon regarding the penicillin allergy, but I do not expect it to come back before the surgery happens. It will not hurt him to have that validated pro or con down the line, regardless. ",,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation June 16, 2022.  He was reporting leg 
weakness and lack of coordination.  He has a foot drop on the right and has tripped.  
There is not so much pain, but the weakness and lack of control of his legs and feet 
is his main concern.  He cannot walk without the aid of a walker.  He did not report 
any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  He 
was also reporting neck pain.  Mr. Smith has attended for physical therapy without 
relief.  He relates disrupted sleep due to neck pain.  Mr. Smith has very significant 
challenges with performing chores due to his mobility issues.  He has standing 
tolerance of less than 5 minutes, and walking of 5 to 10 minutes (with support).  His 
general medical history is unremarkable other than hypertension and heart arythmia.  
Mr. Smith presented using a walker.  His gait is spastic. The physical examination 
findings reveal patellar reflexes to be 3+.  Achilles were 1+.  There is preserved 
power of knee and hip flexion and extension, but there is profound weakness of foot 
dorsi and plantar flexion to resisted testing.  Vibration sense is absent in his feet.  
Superficial sensation is also significantly reduced.  There is a positive Smith's 
test.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  In the upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no dysdiadokokinesia.
A lumbar MRI was performed December 16, 2021.  There is severe canal and 
foraminal stenosis at L3-4, mild to moderate canal stenosis at L2-3 and L4-5, 
moderate left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1, and moderate to severe left foraminal 
stenosis at L2-3.  Images were reviewed with Mr. Smith.
I diagnosed Mr. Smith with acquired lumbar spinal stenosis which is fairly significant 
and he will require a surgical opinion.  However, I was concerned regarding long 
tract signs and about the potential for spinal cord compression in the thoracic or 
cervical spine, which would be of more concern at this point, rather than his lumbar 
spine.  MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was required.  Mr. Smith was advised to 
continue with activity to tolerance and continue to use supports for walking.
On follow-up today Mr. Smith says that his symptoms remain the same.  He is not 
taking pain relieving medications.  The cervical and thoracic MRI's were performed 
July 1, 2022 and reveal moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at C3-4.  There is 
cord compression.  There is moderate canal stenosis at C4-5.
My clinical impression remains the same.  Mr. Smith requires a spine surgical opinion 
with regard to the lumbar and cervical spine stenosis.  I have referred him to Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  he should continue with activity to tolerance.

pain/numbness.  The onset of symptoms was in May 2021.  There is an increase in 
leg paresthesia with walking and relief with sitting.  He is able to get restorative 
sleep.  He continues with self-directed exercises.  Mr. Smith has not had any recent 
physical therapy.  He is not taking any pain relieving medications.  His medical history 
is remarkable for bilateral hip replacements and prostate cancer.  Mr. Smith is 
retired and is able to manage chores at home.
The physical examination findings reveal the right patellar reflex to be 1+ while other 
reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 5/5, except for the right quadriceps which is 4+/5.  
Sensation is diminished along the right L3 and L4 dermatomes.  There is no nerve 
root tension with supine straight leg raising.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is 
negative Hoffman's sign.  There is no spasticity or clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed January 2, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L4-5.  There is significant right lateral recess stenosis at L3-4.  There is a 
degenerative scoliosis.
Mr. Smith presents with neurogenic claudication and symptoms and signs of right 
L3-4 radiculopathy.  His back pain is mechanical in nature.  Given the ongoing

Given that this would be more extensive surgery as he would require removal of the rods as well as insertion of longer rods to span the entire decompression, he and his wife opted to think about it. They will call us back and make an appointment should they want to book surgery",,"Mr. Smith was seen for consultation initially on June 17, 2022.  He presented with 
a complaint of worsening left leg weakness and foot drop.  He had had painful 
paresthesia in the left leg for years.  He underwent an L2-3 lumbar fusion in 2018.  
Mr. Smith had been attending for physical therapy months and had massage 
therapy at first.  He reported a limited walking tolerance of 5 to 10 minutes, and 
standing of less than 5 minutes.  He was able to get restorative sleep.  The physical 
examination findings revealed profound weakness of resisted left foot dorsiflexion 
and EHL.  There was no nerve root tension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the 
patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation was diminished along the left L4 and L5 
dermatomes.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
There is no clonus or spasticity.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.
A lumbar MRI was performed in 2016 (prior to his decompression/fusion in 2018) 
and this reveals moderate to severe canal stenosis at L2-3.  I diagnosed Mr. 
Smith with a left L4/5 radiculopathy and progressive foot drop.  An updated MRI 
had been requisitioned and I recommended to Mr. Smith that I follow-up with him 
after the MRI.
The MRI was performed at GNMI on July 18, 2022.  There is artifact from prior 
surgery at L2-3.  At L4-5 there is severe spinal canal stenosis from a combination of 
degenerative changes.  
My clinical impression remains the same.  Given the MRI findings of severe canal 
stenosis at L4-5, ongoing leg dominant pain and weakness and impact on his quality 
of life, I have referred Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to 
tolerance.

We are hesitant to offer surgery at this time given imaging results.  He tells us that he has EMG results from January of this year. We cannot access these results in clinic, and have therefore asked him to send the study to Dr. Pahuta. We have also discussed conservative treatment options including specialized pain therapies as alternatives to surgical intervention. We have recommended that he speak to his neurologist regarding his muscle atrophy.  We would be happy to follow up with Kevin via phone appointment once we have received the EMG results.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right more than left leg pain.  The pain 
in the right leg is at the lateral leg and into the dorsum of the right foot.  The onset 
was in October 2021 and he says that he has experienced a little improvement.  The 
pain tends to be worse at the end of the day and Mr. Smith says that he has limited 
walking tolerance of 5 to 10 minutes.  He has seen a neurologist, Dr. Smith, who felt 
that site of his prior surgery (L5-S1 disc replacement) has resulted in scarring and 
perhaps arachnoiditis, and is causing radicular symptoms.  Mr. Smith has been 
attending for physical therapy for upper back pain.  His medical history includes 
having had an MI and cardiac stents, dyslipidemia, and as noted he has had prior 
L5-S1 disc replacement.  He is retired and able to manage chores at home. 
Medications include Lyrica, Plavix, a statin, cyclobenzaprine, and Tylenol 3 prn.
The physical examination findings reveal patellar and Achilles reflexes to be 2+.  
Power is graded 5/5 except for resisted right EHL and flexor halluces which are 4+/5.  
Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical  Sensation is preserved and symmetrical.  
There is nerve root tension on the right with straight leg raising and slump test.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is no clonus or spasticity.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally and there are no other long 
tract signs.  There is pain with costovertebral joint challenge in the mid thoracic on 
the left over rib angles.
A lumbar MRI was performed January 26, 0222.  There is moderate bilateral 
foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  There is mild to moderate foraminal stenosis at L2-3 and 
L3-4, and mild right foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of right L5/S1 radiculopathy.  He has 
had prior surgery at L5-S1 (disc replacement) and (in view of prior surgery and 
possible scar tissue) while he may not be the best of surgical candidates, given the 
ongoing right leg pain and my examination findings, consultation is appropriate.  I 
am referring him to Dr. Smith for his expert opinion.  Concurrently, Mr. Smith 
may find relief with pulsed radiofrequency ablation of the right L5 dorsal root 
ganglion and I am referring him to the Bloor Pain Clinic for evaluation and 
consideration for intervention.  They may also want to address his upper back pain 
which I feel is related to costo-vertebral joint irritation/costovertebral syndrome.  Mr. 
Smith should continue with self-directed exercises, and physical therapy if he finds 
relief, and may wish to consider a trial of 10 sessions of spinal 
mobilization/manipulation for his upper back pain.

history is unremarkable.  She does not smoke.  She works as an accountant.  She 
reports that she has limited standing, sitting and walking tolerance of 5 to 10 
minutes.  She is unable to do more physically demanding chores at home.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left S1 radiculopathy.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ except for the left Achilles which is 1+.  Power is 
graded 5/5 except for repeat left single leg calf raise which revealed 
weakness/fatigue.  Sensation is reduced along the left S1 dermatome.  There is a 
positive left straight leg raise and slump test.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent.  There is no spasticity or clonus.  
A lumbar MRI was performed April 1, 2022 and reveals a large left L5-S1 disc 
extrusion with significant compromise of the left lateral recess.
Given the persisting left leg dominant pain, the examination findings, MRI results and 
the continuing impact that the leg pain is having on Ms. Smith's quality of life, I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She can 
continue with chiropractic care if she finds benefit.  She should also continue to see 
her interventionalist, Dr. Smith, as she has found benefit from the procedures.  Ms. 
Smith should be continuing with self-directed exercises at home.

Given the impact is having on his activities of daily living and its chronicity he would certainly be a candidate for operative management in the form of a posterior decompression.  We discussed this today. We discussed complications including, but not limited to: dural tear; infection; wound complications; bleeding; injury to: major vessels, major organs; nerve root injury; weakness; numbness; bowel or bladder dysfunction; failure to improve symptoms; adjacent segment degeneration; instability; revision surgery; wrong-level surgery; blood clot; anesthesia-related risks such as pulmonary/cardiac/cerebrovascular complications, including death, paralysis and blindness. After this, he signed informed consent today.  Our office will be in contact with him for surgical date in the near future.
 ",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  The leg 
symptoms are most troublesome, and worse on the left.  The onset of leg pain was 
in December 2021 and he relates that pain and functional difficulties are worsening.  
He has standing and walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  He has attended for 
physical therapy and acupuncture which he has not found helpful, but an epidural in 
April was helpful for a few weeks.  Mr. Smith's health history is otherwise good.  
He says that recent blood work did not reveal any abnormalities.  He has had prior 
lumbar discectomy at L4-5 in the remote past.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant abnormality.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are symmetrical.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  
Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and 
Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 7, 2022 at GNMI.  The cardinal finding is 
severe spinal canal stenosis at L2-3 and L3-4 from a combination of degenerative 
changes.  
Mr. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication and has significant functional 
limitations at this point.  Given this and MRI findings, I am referring him for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He has been encouraged to continue with 
flexion-based exercises and activity to tolerance in the interim.

As he is also having problems with his right knee we suggested he has his surgical intervention for the knee prior to any surgery for his back.  He can continue following up with Dr. Dos Santos in regards to his back and will need a repeat MRI prior to returning to clinic with Dr. Pahuta if needed in the future.  We have advised him to continue to be active with non load bearing activities such as biking and swimming.,,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain and weakness.  He relates that 
most of the pain is about the right knee, but there is also heaviness of the leg and it 
can give way.  He relates that he has been using a cane for about 1 year to improve 
his stability.  Mr. Smith relates that his walking tolerance is only about 20 years.  His 
sleep is not disrupted.  His medical history is remarkable for a myocardial infarction 
and stent.
The physical examination significant mobility issues.  Mr. Smith reports that his 
walking tolerance is only about 20 yards.  He presented today in a wheelchair.  The 
examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  Power is preserved 
at 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished in the right foot in a 
non-dermatomal distribution.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ bilaterally at the 
Patellae and Achilles.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  There 
is no spasticity or clonus, or other signs of myelopathy.  There is hypertrophy of the 
right knee joint and tenderness about the knee and joint lines.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed March 4, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5, L3-4 and 
L2-3 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is significant buckling of 
nerve roots at the conus.
It is my clinical impression that Mr. Smith is experiencing unilateral neurogenic 
claudication.  Much of his ambulation difficulties however may in fact be from the 
arthritic right knee for which he is to undergo a knee replacement.  He says that a 
surgical date has yet to be established.
At this time, given the deterioration of his functioning and MRI findings, and not 
withstanding the concomitant right knee issue, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

I discussed the nature of the surgery as well as the fact that despite the minimally invasive access it still a large procedure with a fusion construct that would be placed.  My advice would be to continue with his current nonsurgical treatment plan.  This is in light of the fact that things are slowly improving. If his leg pain starts to get worse and there are no other relief that he can get from the various treatment that he is receiving, then at that point I would consider surgical decompression and fusion.  The patient is advised that he can give my office a call anytime in the next few years if things get worse and I can see him in a more expedited fashion.  It was a pleasure seeing  Serge Donald Lauzon  in clinic today.  Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient.
 ",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain and lower back pain.  The 
onset was about 10 years ago when he fell about 40 feet, sustained an L1 vertebral 
body fracture.  He was getting right gluteal and calf pain, but reports feeling much 
better since taking Lyrica.  Physical therapy and osteopathy were helpful.  His 
medical history includes diabetes and dyslipidemia.  He is a non-smoker.  
Medications include metformin, ozempic and jardiance.  Mr. Smith works as a 
Boiler Technician.  He was off work for 2 months, but is currently working full time.
The physical examination reveals normal gait and Mr. Smith was not using any 
supports.  There is an increase in lower back pain with lumbar spine extension.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is 
graded 5/5 L2 to S1, except for the right EHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Supine straight 
leg raising and slump testing are both non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion were 
normal.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 17, 2022.  There is a Grade I anterolisthesis of 
L5 on S1.  There is severe foraminal stenosis.  Noted is the chronic compression 
fracture of L1 with mild retropulsion of the superior corner.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5 radiculopathy.  Given the ongoing leg 
pain which his chronic, as well as MRI findings, and notwithstanding that he has 
experienced some improvement with Lyrica, I am referring him for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  Mr. Smith should continue with self-directed 
exercises.

In an ideal world we might attempt to objectify that diagnosis with a discogram but that invasive neuro diagnostic modality is no longer available to us regionally. With his wife attending of asked I explained my assessment of the situation today and offered the potential benefit to be had from surgical care here, I would offer him a PLIF reconstruction which in my practice is a routine overnight stay operation with good outcome probability for most people.  Here, the surgery will be a challenge because the man is so big and pain control may be a challenge because he is got a baseline familiarity with Oxycocet so I proposed to admit him in for a few days perioperatively.  We touched on risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues.  On prognostication I have told him that the balance of literature on operating mono segmental for back dominant pain suggests at best a 2 out of 3 probability of significant pain relief, and that the very limited reporting of outcomes for internal lumbar disc derangement is much more favorable. He is agreeable to considering surgery I have explained that this would be entirely elective, he can likely expect it to be a couple of years before elective surgical care would come available to him in this healthcare system.  He seems fine with that and I will put him onto my wait list accordingly",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The pain is chronic for 
about 10 years and worsening. At this time the pain is affecting his quality of life, 
and he relates limited standing tolerance.  Pain is disturbing his sleep and he has an 
increase in pain with lying down.  He has done physical therapy, massage, 
osteopathy and chiropractic care.  He relates that chiropractic care helps a little.  He 
takes OxyContin qhs for pain relief.  He did have a medial branch block which helped 
for about a month.  He is scheduled for follow-up in December 2022.  Other 
medications include dutasteride, rosuvastatin, afluzosin, and edarbi.  Mr. Smith 
reports a secondary complaint of numbness through the left anterior thigh.  His 
medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
Reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in 
all dermatomes.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  There are no long tract 
signs.  There is tenderness at the lumbosacral level, and there is a positive Smith's 
test (lumbar rotation with extension) on the left.  A lumbar MRI was performed 
September 4, 2021 which reveals degenerative disc disease.  The cardinal finding is 
at L5-S1 where there is advanced L5-S1 degeneration, modic changes of endplates 
and on personal review the disc collapse is more prominent on the left.
Mr. Smith has mechanical back pain related to the degenerative changes at L5-S1.  
Typically, the best surgical outcomes are for leg dominant pain.  In this case, 
however, given the worsening lower back pain and disabling nature of pain, as well 
as imaging and examination findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith to determine if he might be a candidate for a 
lumbo-sacral fusion.  Lumbar plain film radiographs were performed today in 
preparation of that consultation.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that he 
follow-up with the pain clinic.  He should be continuing with self-directed exercises, 
and can continue with chiropractic care if he finds relief.

193,193,471,2022-06-23 00:00:00,Yes,No,No,0,1,225,4,1.0,0.0,0.0,My feeling is the patient has neurogenic claudication arising from spinal stenosis at L2-3 and L4-5.  As result I offered him a decompression laminectomy from L2-3 and L4-5 which essentially will turn out to be an L2-5 decompression laminectomy.  It indicates a fusion operation but I will get dynamic films on the patient today.  I explained to him that I think is a reasonable chance his symptoms in his legs will improve following the surgery but of course there is no guarantee.  There is a risk of worsening back pain worsening pain weakness numbness in his leg or legs or bowel bladder dysfunction.  There is risk of CSF leak and infection as well as anesthetic risks and instability in the spine.  I did discuss conservative with the patient including return to the pain clinic physical therapy but the patient is in favor proceeding with an operation which I think is reasonable.  We will book the case in the next few months.  The patient is traveling to Germany and returns at the end of September.  I look forward to seeing him again.,,"The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith to be neurologically intact.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+, except the right patellar reflex which is 1+.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 5/5 
L2 to S1 bilaterally.  There is no nerve root tension with straight leg raising.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes 
are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no spasticity or clonus.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed March 12, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal stenosis 
at L2-3.  There is also moderate to severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally.  There is 
severe canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  These 
findings are concordant to his symptoms.  Given his reduced functioning and the 
impact that symptoms are having on his quality of life, I am referring Mr. Smith for a 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

We discussed the possibility of doing surgical intervention for decompression with a lumbar laminectomy at L4-5.  Jacqueline wanted some time to think about surgery.  We will have her send her a note from her neurologist and follow-up with us with a telephone appointment if she would like to go ahead with surgery.,,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left leg pain.  The onset 
was years ago and pain is worsening.  She has limited walking tolerance.  
Chiropractic care and massage have helped a little.  She also has balance issues for 
which she has seen a neurologist.  Her medical history includes hypertension and 
diabetes.  She does not smoke.  She is taking Pregabalin 75 mg qid, and oxycocet 
prn.  Other medications include: perindopril, invokana, and Smith.
The physical examination reveals findings commensurate with left L4/5 
radiculopathy.  There is diminished sensation along the left L5 dermatome.  There is 
a positive straight leg raise.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and 1+ on 
the left Achille and 2+ on the right.  There are no long track/pyramidal signs.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits.  Lumbar MRI performed December 20, 2021 reveals a disc protrusion 
at L4-5 and left lateral recess stenosis.  A cervical spine MRI performed March 13, 
2022 reveals a disc/osteophyte complex at C5-6, moderate canal and severe 
foraminal stenosis.
Given the ongoing and disabling left leg pain and MRI findings, as well as limited 
response to conservative care, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  She should continue with self-directed exercises 
and activity to tolerance.

heaviness.  The onset was a few years ago, with worsening symptoms and declining 
functioning.  She can only walk about 20 feet.  She has fallen a few times.  A couple 
of years ago she tried physical therapy, acupuncture and massage without relief.  
She takes 6 tablets of Tylenol 3 per day.  Her medical history includes having had 2 
strokes and she has had intra arterial coiling for a brain aneurysm.  She has 
diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She is a non-smoker.

stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is 
foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.

of leg dominant pain, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. 
Smith.  I have encouraged her to consider a walking aid to minimize the chance 
of further falls.  I have encouraged her to be active within her envelope of tolerance.

not smoke.  He is allergic to penicillin.  Mr. Smith has not been able to return to his 
work as a Machine Operator since October 1, 2021.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right S1 radiculopathy.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 4+/5 for the right flexor halluces.  
Otherwise power is 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  There is negative straight leg raising on the right, but there is 
crossover into the right buttock and posterior thigh with left straight leg raising.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI was performed September 18, 2021.  The cardinal finding is a right 
L5-S1 paracentral disc herniation.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a right S1 radiculopathy.  His 
symptoms are debilitating and he has not been able to resume gainful employment.  
Given the persisting leg dominant pain, examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  In the interim, Mr. 
Smith should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include  continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections  And surgical intervention  . We mutually agreed to pursue surgery, which was offered in the form of a minimally invasive right-sided approach for L4-5 bilateral canal enlargement with resection of bilateral facet cysts including an over-the-top approach for decompression of the left cyst. The rationale for the procedure and reasonably forseeable risks were explained, which include but are not limited to, those of general anesthesia, including death, stroke, paralysis and blindness, risks of bleeding and infection potentially requiring revision surgery, and risks specific to this procedure, including  cauda equina  or nerve root injury with temporary or permanent weakness, numbness and/or loss of bowel/bladder control, durotomy with CSF leak potentially requiring revision surgery, failure of symptomatic improvement,    , index or adjacent segment degeneration including disc reherniation, wrong level surgery.  Patricia  asked appropriate questions and provided informed consent. Our office will arrange for an appointment with the pre-operative Anesthesia clinic, and subsequently arrange an operative date..  Our office will arrange for an appointment with the Anesthesia Pre-Operative Clinic, and subsequently arrange an operative date at the earliest opportunity. .",,"Ms. Smith presents with a 6 month history of left buttock and leg pain which is 
worsening.  Exercises have not been helping, and she has also had injections which 
have not helped.  The pain disturbs her sleep.  She was unable to perform her job 
duties and was let go.  Ms. Smith does not report any change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She is taking 
Tramadol HCL 100 mg x 3 qhs, Baclofen 1 to 2 tabs per day, and Fluvoxamine 100 
mg x 3 qhs, as well as Pantoprazole.  Her health in general is good.  She is a 
non-smoker and does not have any known allergies.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5/S1 radiculopathy.  
Muscle  stretch reflexes are 2+ bilaterally.  There are a couple of beats of clonus of 
the left foot.  Power is grade 5/5 L2 to S1, except for resisted left EHL, foot 
dorsiflexion and hamstrings which were graded 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along 
the left L5 dermatome.  There is diminished muscle bulk and tone of the left calf 
musculature.  There is a positive supine straight leg raise on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 26, 2022.  The cardinal finding is at L4-5 where 
there are synovial cysts, more prominent on the left with compromise of the lateral 
recess.  These findings explain her symptoms.
At this time, given the worsening and disabling left leg pain, examination and MRI 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  
An appointment has been arranged for July 5, 2022.  In the interim, Ms. Smith 
should continue with activity to tolerance.  She says that she has tried Smith but this 
produced weight gain.  I have recommended that perhaps another neuromodulator 
could be tried, eg Gabapentin, but that she should speak to her physician.

and incomplete voiding of her bladder.  There is an increase in pain with standing, 
sitting and walking.  The majority of her pain is in the left thigh.  Physical therapy 
was not helpful.  Ms. Smith relates very limited walking tolerance and she is using 
walking sticks.  Her symptoms are worsening.  She relates that she has seen an 
internist and neurologist.  An MRI of the lumbar spine and pelvis has been ordered.  
Her medical history is rather unremarkable.  Her surgical history includes a stent in 
the left subclavian artery.
The physical examination findings reveal the left patellar reflex to be a little sluggish 
compared to the right.  There is a positive slump test on the left, and positive 
femoral nerve stretch test on the left.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There are no long tract/pyramidal signs.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed May 4, 2021 and reveals degenerative disc changes.  There is a slight 
disc protrusion on the left at L2-3.  Ms. Smith had an EMG study, but the results 
are not available today.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing a left L3 radiculopathy.  
This diagnosis would not explain all of her symptoms, including reported weakness 
and very limited walking tolerance.  She is to have an updated MRI and follow up 
with her neurologist.  I have recommended that I could follow-up with her after that.  
At this point there is nothing from the examination or imaging to date that would 
prompt me to refer her for a spine surgical consultation.  The constellation of 
symptoms have yet to be fully diagnosed.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

Imaging suggests mild-moderate degenerative changes, and physical exam was largely unremarkable, with the exception of some weakness in the right EHL.  At this juncture, we do not believe Mr. Leduc would be a candidate for surgery as his pain appears to be more so due to referred pain from his lower lumbar spine as opposed to nerve root compression.  We recommended following up with the pain clinic he has recently seen to inquire about epidural steroid injections. Thank you for involving us in the care of this patient.

He has an appointment with a neurologist in the near future I think overall the problem here is finding with the cause of his symptoms are.  Possibly this is inflamed nerve root or roots and lumbar spine or possibly this could be a peripheral nerve issue.  In future if there is any information that warrants my reassessing him I be happy to do so but for now not booked any further follow-up appointments.,No concrete treatment options given there being no clear cause of symtpoms. Patient has a pending neurology appoimtent ,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation on July 5, 2021.  He was reporting left 
leg pain to the ankle, and also lower back pain.  Symptoms had been present for 
more than a year.  He had undergone physical therapy, traction and acupuncture 
without relief.  He had injections at a pain clinic with only temporary relief.  His 
health history was only remarkable for high uric acid levels.  The only medications he 
was taking were Ibuprofen prn, and Allopurinol.  The pain was having a significant 
impact on his quality of life and cannot ski or walk for distance.  The physical 
examination revealed normal gait and no antalgia.  He could not perform toe walking 
or single leg calf raise on the left due to weakness.  Sensation was diminished along 
the left L4 dermatome.  There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  Hip ranges 
of motion were within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes were 2+ and Hoffman's 
sign was absent bilaterally.  A lumbar MRI was performed January 24, 2022.  There 
is moderate to severe right and moderate left foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  There is 
degenerative disc bulging at L4-5 and L5-S1.  My clinical impression was that Mr. 
Vickers had left L4 and S1 radiculopathy, and there may be neuropathic pain.  I 
referred him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith and recommended 
EMG study.  I recommended that he continue with self-directed exercises.
Mr. Smith reports that he continues to experience left leg pain and weakness.  He 
is beginning to experience some pain on the right.  He is still performing self-directed 
exercises and is able to bike.  He feels that his symptoms are slightly worse than 
when I saw him.  He is not taking any pain relieving medications regularly.  His 
overall health remains the same.
My clinical impression remains the same.  He is awaiting a surgical consultation.  I 
recommend that consideration be given to referring him for neurology consultation 
and also for referral for epidural injection.  Perhaps he can discuss with his current 
interventionalist.  I recommend that an updated lumbar MRI be considered given his 
worsening symptoms.  I would be pleased to follow-up with him afterwards should 
this be requisitioned.

N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left leg pain.  The onset was in January 
2021 as a result of a fall.  The leg pain intensified after endometriosis surgery in 
October.  She has been receiving intramuscular injections which only help a little.  
She is also seeing a chiropractor weekly and treatment helps with her mobility.  
Overall, her leg pain is not substantively improved.  Her health in general is good 
other than a history of endometriosis and hypertension.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with a left S1 radiculopathy.  
There are nerve root tension signs.  A lumbar MRI performed November 14, 2021 
reveals a left L5-S1 disc extrusion with compression of the left S1 nerve root.
Given the unremitting left leg dominant pain, physical examination findings and MRI 
results, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation.  I am referring her 
to Dr. D. Guha for his expert opinion.  She should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises.  She can continue with chiropractic care if she finds benefit.  Weight loss 
is encouraged.

Mr. Smith was seen today on a request for expedited consultation from Dr. Smith.  Mr. Smith presents with his wife.  He has limited walking and standing 
tolerance (less than 5 minutes) and was in a wheelchair.  He is reporting limited 
walking tolerance, but his chief complaint is weakness and incoordination.  The onset 
of symptoms was about 5 months ago.  He also has lower back pain.  He has 
diabetes and has a history of a remote brain injury.  He smokes about 1.5 packs of 
cigarettes per day. 
The physical examination findings reveal long tract/pyramidal signs.  There are 
upgoing toes bilaterally.  He has dysdiadikokinesia.  There is a positive Hoffman's 
sign on the right.  Patellar and upper limb reflexes are hyperreflexic.  He has weak 
grip strength on the right.  Mr. Smith has balance problems and could not heel/toe 
walk.
The findings are commensurate with cervical spine myelopathy, likely from a 
spondylotic process.  He has some mechanical lower back pain, and I would not rule 
out lumbar stenosis, but the main concern at this time is the cervical spine.  Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon, was in the clinic today and kindly saw Mr. 
Smith.  An expedited cervical spine MRI was requisitioned.  Mr. Smith will be 
following up with Mr. Smith and there is no need for follow-up with my self at this 
point.  Longer term, if Mr. Smith has continuing back and leg symptoms then I 
would be pleased to see him again.

paresthesia in his feet and legs, and pain in his buttocks.  The onset was a few years 
ago and symptoms were worsening, despite having tried chiropractic care and 
physical therapy.  He had also had injections.  Doppler study of the lower limbs was 
reportedly normal.  His symptoms used to be present only with walking and 
prolonged standing, but now they are more constant.  The clinical presentation was 
consistent with neurogenic claudication.  The physical examination does not reveal 
any significant neurological deficit, other than mildly weak right EHL.  An MRI of the 
lumbar spine was performed in 2018 which reveals canal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5.  
An updated MRI was required.
The updated lumbar MRI was performed February 25, 2022 and reveals severe 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  
At this time, Mr. Smith says that his symptoms remain the same and leg pain is 
worse on the right.  He has limited walking and standing tolerance.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, functional limitations and MRI results, I am 
referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the 
interim, he should continue with self-directed flexion based exercises.

He reported 
intermittent left buttock pain, and previously had left leg pain which resolved.  He 
had experienced significant improvement.  Mr. Smith has a prior history of lower 
back pain which has responded to chiropractic care.  He was continuing to perform 
home based exercises regularly.  His health in general is essentially unremarkable.  
The physical examination findings did not reveal any significant motor deficit, other 
than diminished left patellar reflex.  There is no nerve root tension.  MRI of his 
lumbar spine was performed May 28, 2019 reveals moderate to severe canal 
stenosis at L4-5 and left foraminal stenosis at the same level.  My clinical impression 
was that Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of a left L4 radiculopathy.  Given the 
improvement, and notwithstanding the MRI findings, there was no identified need for 
updated advanced imaging or referral for surgical consultation.  
Mr. Smith says that since I saw him in February his condition has declined.  There 
is significantly more pain.  He has attended for physical therapy on three occasions, 
massage and acupuncture without relief.  Most of the pain currently is in the left 
buttock and bilateral leg pain and heaviness.  There is an increase in pain with 
walking and standing, and relief with sitting.  Symptoms are not too bad at night and 
he indicates getting restful sleep.  He is taking Pregabalin 50 mg bid for pain relief.
The physical examination findings reveals power to be 5/5 L2 to S1.  There is 
symmetrical muscle tone and bulk.  Reflexes are 1+ except for the right patellar 
reflex which is 2+.  Muscle tone and bulk is normal and symmetrical.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is no clonus or 
spasticity.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain and the impact on his functioning, as well as 
MRI findings, I have referred Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also requisitioned an updated lumbar MRI, but a requisition could 
also be outside the General if the wait is shorter.  Mr. Smith should continue with

for a few years.  He has been prescribed exercises which have little affect.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left S1 radiculopathy.  Mr. 
Smith has mechanical/discogenic lower back pain.  Lumbar MRI performed July 
23, 2021 reveals left L5-S1 disc herniation.
In view of the persisting left leg pain and the impact on his quality of life (he has not 
been able to work), I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. D. Guha.  For his back pain he could trial a course of spinal 
mobilization/manipulation with a chiropractor or manipulatively trained physical 
therapist.  A reasonable trial of treatment would be 10 sessions over a month or so.  
If his back pain remains disabling despite treatment, then consideration should be 
given to referring him to a pain clinic for possible facet joint injections or medial 
branch blocks.  He is encourage to continue with self-directed exercises.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient

 Given the failure of nonoperative treatment I did offer a TLIF from the right side L5-S1. We discussed complications including, but not limited to: dural tear; infection; wound complications; bleeding; injury to: major vessels, major organs; nerve root or spinal cord injury; failure to improve symptoms;weakness; numbness; bowel or bladder dysfunction;  pseudoarthrosis/instrumentation failure; adjacent segment degeneration; revision surgery; malalignment; wrong-level surgery; blood clot; anesthesia-related risks such as pulmonary/cardiac/cerebrovascular complications, including death, paralysis, and blindness. She wished to proceed.",,"I initially saw Ms. Smith on February 15, 2022.  She was reporting lower back and 
right leg pain which began after a fall in 2015 at which time she also fractured her 
pelvis.  She characterizes the leg pain as sharp and shooting pain.  She has tried 
physical therapy without relief.  She is performing home-based exercises.  She has 
limited walking tolerance of only about 3 blocks before she has to sit down.  Based 
on her clinical presentation and my examination, it was my opinion that Ms. Smith 
was experiencing unilateral neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar MRI was required.
The MRI was performed at GNMI on February 28, 2022.  There is moderate spinal 
canal stenosis at L2-3.  There is severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and Grade II 
spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.
In view of the ongoing leg dominant pain and the MRI findings, I am referring Ms. 
Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Ms. Smith should be 
performing activities to tolerance.

Since back pain is dominant over leg pain, we do not believe that an operation is indicated at this time given that risks may outweigh benefits. The patient was agreeable to this plan. He may benefit from injections at the L3-L4 facet joints. These should be done under image guidance. His family doctor may consider a referral to DeGroote Pain clinic or Dr. Sussman at Credit Valley. If there is anything we can do to further assist you in the care of this patient, please do not hesitate to contact us. ",,"I saw Mr. Smith for consultation February 15, 2022.  He was reporting lower back 
and leg pain, characterized as a burning and paresthesia.  He can experience sharp 
pain in the right leg at times.  He has limited walking and standing tolerance.  He had 
tried physical therapy without relief and had attended at a pain clinic.  He was 
continuing with self-directed, home based exercises.  His medical history includes 
essential hypertension, diabetes, Smith's esophagus, anxiety, and COPD.  Mr. 
Smith had left femoral artery stent surgery which was helpful for some of the left 
leg pain.
The clinical presentation was commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  I 
requisitioned a lumbar MRI and was to follow-up with Mr. Smith post-MRI.
The MRI was performed April 28, 2022 and reveals a cardinal finding of severe 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is 
moderate canal stenosis at L4-5.
At this time Mr. Smith reports that his pain and functional limitations remain the 
same.  He has limited walking tolerance of 50 to 100 feet.
Given the ongoing functional limitations and pain, as well as MRI findings of severe 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with 
self-directed flexion-based exercises.

manifesting today as mild weakness in his extensor hallucis longus, but most
debilitatingly, he has rather severe pain which has been refractory to multimodal amounts
of pain management, including injections locally, medical management, as well as
chiropractic manipulation. Overall, given the gradually progressive nature of his pain as well as refractory nature
to other modalities of treatment, we agreed that this may be a reasonable surgical
candidate to proceed and Mr. MacNeil was in agreement.  We discussed the risks and
benefits of surgery and Mr. MacNeil signed consent today as he was keen on proceeding
with surgery.  However, he wishes to attempt to try to use further local injections near
the root to try to calm his pain in the meantime as well as try to play golf throughout
the summer season and as such, he would like to defer surgery into the fall of this year.
We will hold off on booking him for now, but he will proceed by calling us back as well
as requesting a surgical date and anesthesia consult at that time.  The procedure will be
for right-sided L4-L5 minimally invasive surgery for foraminectomy plus/minus discectomy.
In the meantime, we have advised him to continue on his injections locally which provide
him approximately 6 weeks of pain relief.
 ",,"Mr. Smith presents with leg more than lower back pain.  He describes constant 
right lateral leg pain (burning) which began about 5 years ago.  He reports a 
cramping and lancinating pain at the posterior left thigh.  He has cramping in his 
calves.  He does not report his lower back pain to be a significant issue.  He had 
chiropractic care at first, but there was no lasting relief.  He has been receiving 
epidural injections every three months, with variable levels of relief.  He says that his 
sleep is not disrupted.  His health in general is good.  His standing tolerance is less 
than 5 minutes due to his symptoms.
The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith to be neurologically intact, other than 
mild weakness of the right EHL.  There is some nerve root tension on the right with 
slump testing.  Advanced imaging has not been performed, but plain films of the 
lumbar spine performed in 2018 reveal disc space loss at L5-S1.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5 
radiculopathy.  There may be L5 root irritation to account for the left leg pain.  Given 
the ongoing leg dominant pain and impact on his quality of life, I have requisitioned a 
lumbar MRI and will be following up with him after the MRI.  In the interim, he 
should be continuing with self-directed exercises and could pursue a course of 
manual treatment with a chiropractor or manually trained physical therapist for 
lower back pain.

His imaging is congruent with his clinical presentation.  We discussed the various treatment options.  From a surgical standpoint and L4-5 decompression would be a reasonable consideration to decompress his L5 nerve roots bilaterally.  Currently his symptoms are relatively well managed.  However the patient still feels that his activities are quite limited.  He would like to be placed in the queue for surgery.  If he symptoms are not overly bothersome and he understands he can cancel surgery at any time.  
",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and bilateral leg pain.  The onset 
was a few years ago, although he does have a history of chronic lower back pain.  
Symptoms have not improved.  He reports limited standing tolerance of about 5 
minutes.  Sitting provides relief.  He has not found benefit from exercises.  For pain 
relief Mr. Smith is taking Anacin.  His medical history includes diabetes and essential 
hypertension for which he takes Smith, jardiance and perindopril.  Mr. Smith is a 
non-smoker.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
Reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 
5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion 
are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed September 28, 2021.  There is a broad based disc 
herniation at L4-5.  There is severe canal and moderate foraminal stenosis.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms consistent with neurogenic claudication.  Given the 
ongoing pain and impact on his functioning, I am referring him for a spine surgical 
consultation.  I am referring him to Dr. Smith.  For his back pain he could trial side 
posture spinal mobilization/manipulation.  A reasonable trial would be 10 sessions 
over a month.  If he is not responsive, then consideration could be given to referring 
him to a pain clinic for facet joint/medial branch blocks.  He should be continuing 
with self-directed exercises.

The onset 
was in November 2021, although he has had a prior episode which resolved.  He 
characterizes the pain as sharp and which travels as distal as the lateral ankle.  He 
does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal 
numbness.  Exercises have not provided relief.  His medical history includes essential 
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and benign fasculation syndrome.  Mr. Smith had 
lumbar surgery (L4-5 fusion) in 2003, and he had a cardiac stent implanted in 2016.
The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith to be neurologically intact.  Reflexes 
are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 
bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is reduced to sharp 
testing along the right L4 and S1 dermatomes.  Straight leg raising caused right 
buttock pain.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and non-provocative.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  A lumbar MRI 
was performed in March 2019 and this reveals significant spinal canal stenosis at 
L3-4 and L4-5, and moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L3-4.
Mr. Smith presents with right leg radicular symptoms, likely related to the stenotic

The pain is in the left leg to the calf, and characterized as an ache and throb.  There 
is an increase in pain with walking (limited to less than 1 block) and standing (less 
than 5 minutes), and relief with lying down.  Exercises are not helpful.  Mr. 
Smith says that pain is worsening and his functioning has deteriorated.  He 
has tried physical therapy, acupuncture, massage and chiropractic care without 
significant relief.  Tens and exercises are not helping.  Medications include 
Gabapentin and Acetaminophen.  The only other medication he is taking is a statin.  
His health in general is good other than dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
There is weakness of the left EHL 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished in the left L5 
dermatome at the autonomous zone between the first and second digits.  There is 
no nerve root tension with straight leg raising.  Patellar and Achilles reflexes are 1+ 
and 2+ at the Achilles.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  Power 
is 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except the left EHL which is 4+/5.  Supine straight leg 
raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI was performed April 24, 2022.  On personal review of the images 
there is facet hypertrophy at L4-5 on the left with lateral recess stenosis and 
compression of the left L5 nerve root.

ache through the right anterior thigh.  She has some paresthesia in the left great 
toe.  She has OA of the left knee, but her health is otherwise good.  She does not 
smoke.  She is not taking any pain relieving medication.  The only medication she is 
taking is estrogel.
The physical examination reveals her to be neurologically intact.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 
bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  She could heel and toe walk 
without difficulty and Smith test is unremarkable.  Vibration and position sense is 
preserved in the lower and upper limbs.  There is no clonus or spasticity, or other 
pyramidal signs.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is tenderness 
to segmental challenge in the lower lumbar spine.
A thoracic MRI was performed May 31, 2022.  There is a large disc protrusion at 
T10-11 with mass affect on the thecal sac and cord.  Xrays of the lumbar spine 
reveal degenerative disc disease at L5-S1 and L3-4.
Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back pain.  She has a thoracic disc herniation at 
T10-11 with mass affect on the cord.  The age of the herniation is unknown.  While 
she is neurologically normal on physical examination, the disc herniation will require 
monitoring.  I have requisitioned a CT scan to evaluate for any calcification and have 
referred her to Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  For her back pain, since 
she has not responded to chiropractic care, I have referred Ms. Smith to a pain 
clinic for medial branch/facet joint blocks.  She should be continuing with 
self-directed exercises.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and posterior left thigh pain.  The 
onset was in April 2021 and he has not experienced any substantive improvement, 
despite exercises and a course of chiropractic care.  He does not report any change 
to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle 
anesthesia.  His health is otherwise good.  He is a non-smoker.  He is able to 
manage chores around the home, and is continuing to work.  He can no longer run.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and 2+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  
Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, 
except for left EHL and to resisted foot dorsiflexion at 4+/5.  Hip ranges of motion 
are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.  There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 25, 2022.  There is an L4-5 large broad 
based disc protrusion with severe canal stenosis.  There is abutment and 
displacement of L5 nerve roots, more prominent on the left.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of a left L5 radiculopathy.  Given the ongoing pain, 
lack of improvement despite the passage of time, and impact on his quality of life, as 
well as MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. 
Smith.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with self-directed exercises.

the medial leg to ankle and there is associated painful numbness.  The onset was 
more than a year ago with no substantive improvement despite chiropractic care and 
physical therapy.  He does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, 
and there is no perineal numbness.  His health in general is good.  He is a 
non-smoker.  He is allergic to codeine.  He continues to work as an Electrician.
The physical examination reveals an increase in pain with lumbar extension.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ except for the left patellar reflex which is 1+.  Power is 
graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished along the left L4 
dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed January 24, 2022.  There is moderate to severe spinal 
canal stenosis at L4-5.  There is lateral recess stenosis and impingement of the left 
L5 nerve root.  There is moderate to severe left L4-5 foraminal stenosis.  There is a 
disc protrusion at T11-12 with signs of Smith.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of left L4 radiculopathy.  There are signs 
of Smith at T11-12 but no overt signs of myelopathy on physical examination.  
There are corresponding findings for the left L4 radiculopathy diagnosis on MRI 
which reveals moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L4-5 on the left, and lateral 
recess stenosis.  Given the ongoing and unremitting left leg dominant pain, 
examination and MRI findings, and failure to respond to conservative care, I am 
referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Mr. Smith should 
continue with flexion-based exercises and activity to tolerance.

and S1 dermatomes.  There is nerve root tension on the left with straight leg raising.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 21, 2022.  The cardinal finding is a large left 
L4-5 disc herniation.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing a left L5 radiculopathy.  
Given the worsening of pain, lack of substantive improvement despite therapy and 
the passage of time, examination and MRI findings, I am referring her for spine 
surgical consultation.  I am referring Ms. Smith to Dr. D. Guha.  She should be 
continuing with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

Her right leg pain has also largely resolved after a chiro session in Sept 2022 and she has remained pain free. She had full motor / sensory function on exam. At this time there is no role for surgery. She does have a herniated disk that would explain her radicular pain at the time but this has resolved without any surgery. She should continue current conservative management. If she becomes symptomatic again she should obtain a new MRI and be referred to us for reassessment.
 
Regarding her incidental finding of T7-8 disk indenting the cord, we explained to her that there is a lot of room for her cord in the canal and there is no signal changes on the cord. She also has no symptoms at that dermatome. She doesn't require an intervention for this. If she does become symptomatic we can reassess this with an MRI. We discussed this with patient and she understands",,"Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a right S1 radiculopathy.  There is

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections And surgery. We mutually agreed to pursue surgery which was offered in the form of an L3-5 decompression with or without instrumented fusion. We discussed the relative pros and cons of upfront posterolateral instrumentation and fusion and given her borderline grade 2 anterolisthesis I did first offer the posterolateral fusion. The patient however does have some significant reluctance for instrumentation as she has a family member who has had a poor experience with instrumented spinal surgery and Mississauga. After long discussion she therefore elected to pursue decompression alone and she is understanding of the relative pros and cons including the potential for further slippage and further revision spine surgery down the road. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of bilateral leg pain, right more than left.  She 
characterizes the pain as a burning, tingling and heaviness with limited walking 
tolerance of less than a block (less than 5 minutes of standing or walking).  She says 
that the pain has been present for a couple of years and is worsening.  She does not 
report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal 
numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She is doing several exercises, but has not had any 
formal physical therapy.  She is taking Pregabalin 75 mg 3 tab bid, and Tylenol xtra 
strength 2 to 4 per day.  Her medical history includes diabetes, essential 
hypertension and dyslipidemia.  Other medications include: atorvastatin, janumet, 
trazodone, candesartan, alendronate, jardiance.
The physical examination reveals that she could not toe walk due to the bunion on 
the right foot.  She was using a walker.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+, except for 
the left patellar reflex which is 2+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 17, 2020.  The cardinal finding is severe 
spinal canal stenosis at l4-5 and moderate right foraminal stenosis.  There is a grade 
I anterolisthesis at L4-5.  There is some canal stenosis at L3-4.
Ms. Smith presents with fairly classic symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  She will 
require a surgical consultation given her functional decline, but an updated MRI is 
required first.  This will reveal if there is any progression of the canal stenosis at 
L3-4. Standing xrays of the lumbar spine were performed today for pre-surgical 
planning.  I have requisitioned an MRI here at HGH as I work under medical 
directives.  However, given wait times at HGH, consideration could also be given to 
requisition of MRI elsewhere (perhaps GNMI) for a more expedited procedure, but 
requisition is deferred to her physician.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
flexion-based exercises.  I will be following up with her after the updated MRI.

She is cautiously interested in going ahead and gave me consent accordingly so I can put her onto the long wait list.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back, right buttock and leg pain to the 
ankle.  The onset was about 1 year ago and symptoms are worsening.  Her sleep is 
significantly disturbed due to pain.  Ms. Smith has had an epidural injection without 
relief.  She relates some sensation of incomplete voiding of the bladder at times, but 
there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She relates limited standing 
and walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  She takes Smith, a couple of tablets 
per day, and Percocet prn for break through pain.  Her medical history includes 
cardiac procedures including ablations, 2 stents and a left bundle branch block.  She 
is hypothyroid.  Other medications include: estrogen/progesterone, bisoprolol, 
pantoprazole, and synthroid.
On physical examination her habitus is noted to be endomorphic.  There is lower 
back pain with lumbar spine extension.  She could heel and toe walk without 
difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  
Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the right EHL which is slightly 
sluggish at 4++/5.  There is symmetrical muscle tone and bulk.  There is no 
spasticity or clonus.  Sensation is diminished to sharp testing along the right L4 and 
S1 dermatomes.  In the upper limbs muscle stretch reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign 
is absent and there are no other pyramidal/long tract signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 5, 2022.  The cardinal finding is a right L4-5 
paracentral disc herniation.  There is facet joint arthropathy.  There is moderate 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of a right L5 radiculopathy.  There are 
corresponding findings on MRI.  She has mechanical lower back pain.  Given the 
primary symptoms of right buttock and leg pain, the lack of improvement despite 
exercises and the passage of time, the impact on her functioning and quality of life, 
examination and MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  Once the buttock and leg pain is addressed and if 
there is persisting back pain, she could consider chiro treatment and perhaps 
referral to a pain clinic for medial branch/facet joint blocks.  Even though the 
exercises have not significantly impacted on her pain, I have encouraged her to 
continue with them to maintain her functioning.

Ditto when she returns to the erect position she unfolds the thoracic spine first and then rolls the hips with the lumbar spine really not moving much at all.
 
I think we can help her with a two-level lumbosacral reconstruction to offload those involved disks.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and leg pain, with the right sided 
pain being 90% of her difficulties.  There is associated numbness in the right leg.  
She has a history of chronic lower back pain, but he leg symptoms have been 
present for several years.  The pain is worsening.  She has attended for osteopathic 
treatment which helps, and physical therapy has provided some relief.  She has also 
attended for injections which provides some relief.  She relates more recent onset of 
neck and right shoulder pain related to stress from financial concerns.  Ms. Smith's 
health in general is otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker.  She works as a 
Bookkeeper, but is having difficulty completing her work due to inability to sit for long 
periods.
The physical examination reveals her to be essentially neurologically intact.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  There is 
some weakness/fatiguability of the right calf to repeat single leg calf raises.  There is 
a positive straight leg raise on the right.  There is tenderness at the right L5-S1 level 
and at the sacroiliac joint.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and 
non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed November 20, 2021.  The cardinal findings are 
degenerative disc changes at L4-5 and L5-S1.  There is a right L5-S1 disc protrusion 
and impingement/mass affect on the right S1 nerve root.  There are modic changes 
at L4-5.
Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with right S1 nerve root 
irritation/radiculopathy.  She also has mechanical lower back pain related to 
degenerative disc and facet joint changes in the lower lumbar spine.  Given her 
limited response to conservative measures, at this time I am referring her for a 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to 
continue with self-directed exercises.  I query whether a neuromodulator such as 
Gabapentin would provide relief, as well as a sleep aid, perhaps Smith.  I 
defer further consideration to her physician.  There is no need for follow-up with 
myself and her surgical candidacy is deferred to Dr. Smith.

He has 
limited walking tolerance and reports diminished balance and he has fallen.  He 
reports a  burning sensation at the front of his thighs and feet, with occasional 
lancinating pain.  He experiences spasms in his calves.  There is an increase in pain 
with sitting, standing and walking.  He is performing stretches and has found cold 
packs helpful.  Mr. Smith is attending at a pain clinic weekly for injections.  Mr. 
Smith is also reporting occasional tingling in his hands.  He has balance issues 
and uses a cane from time to time.  He is taking Lyrical 125 mg per day, and Tylenol 
xtra strength prn.  His health is reported to be otherwise good.  He does have a 
venous disorder of the left lower leg, possibly related to prior major trauma 
requiring ORIF.  He works in Customer Service but has not been able to return to 
work since January 24, 2022.
The physical examination findings are concerning for myelopathy.  Patellar reflexes 
are hyperreflexic and pathologic.  Upper limb reflexes are hyperreflexic.  There is 
positive Hoffman's sign bilaterally.  There is positive Smith and upgoing great toes 
bilaterally.  Power is 5/5 except for the right EHL and FHL.  Supine straight leg 
raising is non provocative.  Vibration sense (128 hz tuning fork) is diminished in the 
right foot.  Upper limb reflexes are 3+.  The pectoral reflexes are hyperreflexic.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Mr. Smith is unable to tandem walk 
and there is positive sharpened Smith test.
There are signs of myelopathy and concern regarding cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy.  Mr. Smith is in the right age category and there are clear long tract 
signs.  An cervical spine lesion would likely be cephalad to C4 given the hyperreflexic 
pectoral reflexes.  He also may have unilateral neurogenic claudication and there are 
signs of right L5 radiculopathy, but his lumbar spine is of secondary concern at this 
time.  He will require a spine surgical consultation, but MRI imaging of his cervical 
spine is required first.  I have referred him to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon, in order 
not to delay the process and have requisitioned a cervical spine MRI.  Mr. Smith 
says that an updated lumbar MRI has already also been ordered.  I have 
recommended to Mr. Smith that he speak to his physician about getting the 
cervical spine elsewhere than HGH.  I work under medical directives and can only 
order it here at HGH where wait times can be long.  A much quicker alternative 
would be GNMI, but I defer the completion of the requisition to his primary care 
physician.  I told Mr. Smith to call me when the cervical MRI is complete and I 
can go over the findings with him.

The onset was 
in December 2021.  He feels that he is improving, however is not certain if this is 
related to medication that he is taking.  About a week ago he forgot to take his pain 
medication (Cymbalta 60 OD) for a day and pain intensely recurred.  He reports 
having occasional tingling sensation on the lateral of the left foot.  Mr. Smith tried 
physical therapy and massage without relief.  He works seasonally as a Chef, is 
currently working, and reports that standing is not too troublesome.  He is limited in 
walking and sitting for about 5 to 10 minutes.  Mr. Smith has essential 
hypertension and smokes about 3/4 pack of cigarettes per day.  He has undergone 
prior L4-5 discectomy in 2011 and total left hip replacement in 2013. He is not 
performing any specific back exercises, but is walking and remaining active.
Other medications include: Amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and rosuvastatin
The physical examination reveals his gait and cadence to be normal.  There is an 
increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  Mr. Smith could heel and toe walk without 
difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+, except for the left Achilles which is 1+.  
Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  
Power is graded 5/5 and there is no weakness with single leg calf raises.  There is a 
positive straight leg raise and slump test on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed at St. Joseph's hospital on April 13, 2022.  The 
cardinal finding is a left paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1 with caudal migration of 
disc material.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of left S1 radiculopathy.  At this time, given his

So, while were waiting to get a update MRI scan done I have suggested we treat his pain with a regular Tylenol pulse because Tylenol of course is not nephrotoxic at all.  He will buy a bottle of 100 Tylenol Extra Strength tablets and religiously take 2 in the morning 1 at lunch 2 at dinner and 1 at bedtime until the bottle runs out at which point he will take stock of things to see if he is had some benefit or not, if it is helped he will buy a second bottle and try getting away with 5 tablets a day or etc. etc.
 
I have also suggested an unorthodox trial of vitamin A supplementation, and the laboratory its known to stimulate disc cell metabolism significantly and for a relatively young patient with disc structure relatively preserved like he has the metabolic stimulation might be helpful.  I have cautioned him the man that this is a off label recommendation and that he does not will be taking big doses of vitamin A for years and years because its cumulatively toxic to the liver and the eyes.  I do think it is worth his while for him to buy a bottle of 100 tablets and take 2 a day until the bottle runs out at which point again he will take stock of potential benefit.",,"The physical examination reveals that Mr. Smith is neurologically intact.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is 
graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits, except 
for the left hip and reduced internal rotation.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent and there are no long tract signs such as clonus or spasticity.  Plantar 
responses are downgoing.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 7, 2022.  There is significant epidural 
lipomatosis at L3-4 and L4-5 with near complete effacement of the thecal sac.  
There is a small disc protrusion at L3-4.
Mr. Smith presents with fairly classic symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  There 
is marked spinal canal stenosis from epidural lipomatosis.  As a result of his 
symptoms and functional limitations Mr. Smith has gained weight.  I have strongly 
encouraged weight loss as this may also help with the epidural lipomatosis.  Given 
his ongoing functional difficulties, I am also referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that he consider 
stationary bicycling as he may be able to tolerate this better than walking for 
cardiovascular conditioning and to help with weight loss.

To surgically treat this fusion would be necessary.  And due to the sagittal imbalance correction the alignment would be necessary.  This will be fairly extensive procedure.  I did outline this to her.  And due to the high-grade spondylolisthesis there is possibility of L5 nerve root injury causing foot drop.
 
She thought about what I outlined.  She does not feel the symptoms are significantly bothersome enough for her to justify having surgery.
 
Therefore she can continue with nonoperative measures.",,"Ms. Checkley-Fearman presents with a complaint of lower back and left more than 
right leg pain.  She has a history of chronic lower back pain, and leg pains have been 
present for several years.  Her symptoms are worsening.  She relates limited 
walking tolerance of only about 5 to 10 minutes.  Exercises help a little.  She 
underwent a course of physical therapy a couple of years ago, but treatment only 
provided her with relief for a few hours.  She has been undergoing epidural 
injections every few months, and this helps for a few days.  Ms. Checkley-Fearman 
is able to void her bladder, but reports some perineal numbness.  Her medical 
history includes a history of breast cancer twice, and kidney cancer.  She has had a 
collapsed lung.  She is a non-smoker.  She is osteoporotic.
Medications include: Tylenol 3 prn, Tylenol xtra strength - 3 or 4 per week, and she 
also uses a multiprofen cream.  The only other medication she takes is risendronate.
The physical examination reveals normal gait.  She was not using any supports.  
There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+, except for the left Achilles reflex which is 1+.  Power is graded 5/5 
except for the EHL's bilaterally at 4+/5.  Sensation to sharp testing is reduced in the 
feet but in a non-dermatomal pattern.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits in a seated position.  Ms. 
Checkley-Fearman could not lie in a supine position, but slump testing did cause leg 
pain/nerve root tension bilaterally.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 10, 2022.  There is a Grade II/III L5-S1 
spondylolisthesis.  There is severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally.
Ms. Checkley-Fearman has signs and symptoms of bilateral L5 radiculopathy, and left 
S1 radiculopathy.  She has chronic back pain related to the significant 
spondylolisthesis.  In view of the worsening symptoms and lack of significant 
improvement with more conservative measures, including epidural injections, as well 
as the impact on her quality of life, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am 
referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She should continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

as the foot.  She describes some weakness of the right foot and slight foot drop.  
The symptoms began insidiously about 2 years ago and she has not experienced any 
significant improvement.  She has been prescribed flexion based exercises, but these 
are not providing significant relief.  Her functioning is affected.  She used to go for 
long walks, but now her walking and standing tolerance is limited to 10 to 20

perineal numbness.  Pain can disturb her sleep.  Medications include: Pregabalin 150 
mg tid, Naproxen 500 mg bid, Dilaudid 2 mg bid, Tylenol 1000 mg tid.  Ms. Smith 
reports that her health is otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker.
The physical examination reveals an increase in left leg pain with lumbar flexion.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+.  Power is graded 5/5 except for profound weakness 
of the left EHL 1+/5, and to resisted foot dorsiflexion 3+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved to sharp sensation in all dermatomes.  There is 
nerve root tension with left straight leg raising and slump testing.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 29, 2022 at HGH.  The cardinal finding is a left 
L4-5 disc herniation with caudal migration.  There is marked left lateral recess 
stenosis.  There is disc dessication at L4-5 and L5-S1.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a left L5 radiculopathy.  I am 
concerned about progressive weakness and left foot drop.  In view of the chronicity 
of symptoms, examination findings, impact on her quality of life and weakness, and 
MRI findings, I am referring her for spine surgical consultation.  I asked that this be 
expedited over the concern for the weakness.  Ms. Smith has been referred to 
Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  I have recommended she perform 
activities to tolerance and continue with exercises.

She describes a 
heaviness and ache in the legs, and reports that her walking tolerance is only a 
couple of hundred meters.  She is also experiencing pain in her back and legs at 
nighttime.  She is limited with her ability to any chores at home.  She does find relief 
with stretching exercises, and has been able to walk on a treadmill.  Ms. Smith 
attended at a couple of pain clinics for injections (intramuscular and image guided) 
without relief.  Her medical history includes diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and OA 
of the great toes which required fusion.  She says that she does have a history of 
mild diabetic neuropathy.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day.

The onset was in November 2021.  The pain in the right thigh is described as a 
burning sensation, and lower back is an ache.  He relates that she has bladder 
retention and has to exert herself to void her bladder and bowel.  There is no saddle 
anesthesia.  She attended a pain clinic for injections without relief.  Physical therapy 
was not helpful.   She is able to get restful sleep.  Her medical history includes a 
history of seizures and migraine headaches.  She has essential hypertension.
On physical examination she presented in the accompaniment of her son.  She was 
using a walker.  She is significantly antalgic to the left.  Due to her mobility issues no 
supine testing was performed.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished 
along the right L3 dermatome.  Seated straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip 
external and internal rotation bilaterally was within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed April 21, 2022.  The images are substantially similar to 
prior study.  There is a right subarticular disc herniation at L1-2 and moderate canal 
stenosis.  There is moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis at L2-3.
Ms. Smith presents with right L2-3 radicular symptoms and there are structural spine 
changes that are causing her antalgia.  There is a degenerative listhesis of her 
spine.  Due to concern for possible vertebral collapse, I requisitioned standing plain 
films of the lumbar spine today and these do not reveal any further collapse.  There 
is demineralization.  There is a Grade I retrolisthesis of L2 on L3.  L2-3 and L4-5 disc 
spaces ae not well assessed due to spine orientation and demineralization.
Ms. Smith was in hospital in April and saw a resident for Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon.  
It was not felt that she had cauda equine syndrome and it was recommended that 
Ms. Smith follow-up with Dr. Guha in his outpatient clinic.  I agree with this 
recommendation, and while her age and bone quality would count against her being 
a likely surgical candidate, the consultation is nevertheless very reasonable.  I have 
encouraged her to perform activities to tolerance and she can apply hot or cold 
compresses if she finds relief.  She should continue to use the walker to minimize 
the chance for a fall.  Neurologically, I did not find any significant deficit.  I have also 
referred her to the DeGroote Pain Clinic for consideration of her candidacy for an 
epidural injection.

list of the torso.  Increased lower back pain was reported with attempted lumbar 
extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+.  Power is diffusely 4/5 in the lower limbs

A lumbar MRI was performed June 16, 2022.  There is multilevel degenerative disc 
changes.  There is spondylotic spondylolisthesis at L4-5.  At the same level there is 
moderate canal and severe right recess and foraminal stenosis.  There are advanced 
degenerative facet changes in the lower lumbar spine.  A lumbar CT scan was 
performed August 3, 2022 reveals degenerative changes.
Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back pain due to degenerative changes and 
spondylotic spondylolisthesis.  She has some neurogenic claudication, but estimates 
that more than 80% of her difficulties are related to the lower back pain.  She has 
had treatment/injections at a pain clinic, and does not wish to pursue further 
treatment in a pain clinic.  She believes that a lumbar fusion is the answer to her 
difficulties.  Given the imaging changes and significant functional limitations, as well 
as failure to respond to more conservative measures, I am referring Ms. Smith for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Ms. Smith should continue with 
activity to tolerance.

And stenosis is quite mild on MRI.  Therefore would recommend referral to physiatry and neurophysiologic studies. The studies were done January 2022.  And they support L5 radiculopathy. Given this new information, I do think radiculopathy is more likely as a pain generator for him.  However given the fairly mild MRI findings I do think confirmatory tests are necessary before considering surgery. I've gone ahead and referred him for a right selective nerve root block of L5 at the DeGroote pain clinic.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock pain.  He uses to have leg 
pain to the foot but this has improved.  In June he had his right knee replaced and 
has just begun a course of rehabilitation.  He therefore is not certain if any residual 
pain in the right leg is related to his knee.  He is walking more and doing home 
based exercises.  Mr. Smith has had physical therapy in the past, and injections 
were helpful.  He is taking hydromorphone and other medications for pain relief, but 
cannot recall the names.  He is taking an statin and medication for anxiety, the name 
of which he could not recall.  He is a non smoker.  He cannot do chores at home.  He 
was working as a Forklift Operator, but is recovering from his knee surgery.
The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith is neurologically intact.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+.  Sensation is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Power is 
graded 5/5 except for some pain apprehension related to his right knee.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+, except triceps which are 3+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI performed September 16, 2021 reveals disc bulging at the right IVF at 
L4-5.  There is abutment of the right L5 nerve root.  There is significant right 
foraminal stenosis.
Mr. Smith is status post right knee replacement and had recently begun rehab.  It is 
possible that he has right L4 nerve root irritation that is causing right buttock pain.  
The pain is no longer lancinating into the lower leg.  I have recommended to Mr. 
Smith that he complete his rehab for the right knee and if the right leg pain recurs 
he could follow-up with me.  He should consider a course of physical therapy for the 
ongoing right buttock pain which may be related to right L4 nerve root irritation.

Given the severity of her symptoms I did offer her a discectomy.  At L5-S1 on the left.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The onset 
was in February 2022 and pain has been worsening.  This is despite having tried 
physical therapy and chiropractic care.  She does not report any change to bowel or 
bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  Pain can awaken her, and 
she finds the worst pain is first thing in the morning.  Her general medical history is 
otherwise unremarkable.  She has asthma and chronic bronchitis, but no recent 
bouts.  She is a non-smoker.  Ms. Smith was working in retail, but has not been able 
to return to work since May 2022.  She is limited in her ability to perform chores at 
home.
Medications for pain include Smith, Diclofenac and Pantoprazole.  Other 
medications include Wellbutrin 150 mg OD and Citalopram 20 mg.
The physical examination findings reveal that she walks with a normal gait.  She was 
not using any supports.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and 
extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the Patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  
Sensation is diminished along the left S1 dermatome.  There is weakness to 
attempted repeat left single leg calf raise.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
There are no trophic or vasomotor changes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the 
left.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits bilaterally and symptom free.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 17, 2022 at St. Joseph's hospital.  The cardinal 
finding is a left broad-based L5-S1 disc herniation.  This affects the lateral recess 
with compression of the S1 nerve root.
In view of the worsening left leg dominant pain despite the passage of time, the 
examination and MRI findings, and failure to respond to conservative care, I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also 
referred her for epidural injection to see if this may proffer her relief.  She should 
continue with activity to tolerance and self-directed exercises.

She is cautiously interested in the surgical alternative after I spent quite some time explaining the problem and proposed surgical care solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues.  She is given me consent accordingly",,"Ms. Smith presents today with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  There is 
numbness in her calves and pain in the ankles.  She has had prior episodes of back 
pain, but feels that her leg pain has only been present since surgery for necrotizing 
fasciitis.  She relates having bladder problems due to muscle damage, but she is 
able to void.  There is no report of any perineal numbness.  Ms. Smith says that 
she has fallen a few times.  He has had massage and intramuscular injections 
without significant relief.  She has limited walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes 
due to leg pain and weakness.  She says that she has fallen on a few occasions.  Ms. 
Smith is not gainfully employed and last worked in 2020 as a caregiver.
The medical history includes necrotizing fasciitis affecting her buttock in 2020 which 
required tissue removal.  She has an ileostomy bag.  She has IDDM, essential 
hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day.  
She is allergies to some antibiotics and latex.
Medications for pain include Smith, 4 per day, and Gabapentin 600 mg tid.  Other 
medications include: insulin, novo rapid, toujeo, rabeprazole, propranolol, Ramipril, 
crestor, macrobid and Celebrex.
The physical examination reveals normal gait and cadence.  There is pain through 
the left posterior thigh with lumbar flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes 
are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation to sharp testing is reduced 
along the right lateral foot and left foot non-dermatomally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 
to S1, except for the left hamstrings which are 4+/5.  Straight leg raising and slump 
testing is positive on the left.  There is some crossover into the left with right SLR.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and symptom free.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI was performed July 4, 2022.  There is a grade I anterolisthesis of L4 
on L5.  There is a left foraminal disc protrusion at L4-5 with moderate foraminal 
stenosis, and midline L5-S1 disc herniation with compression of S1 nerve roots.  
There is degenerative disc disease at L5-S1.
Standing xrays of the lumbar spine performed today reveal Grade I anterolisthesis of 
L4 on L5 and severe loss of intervertebral disc height L5-S1.
Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back pain and signs and symptoms of left S1 
radiculopathy.  Given the unremitting pain and affect on her quality of life, as well as 
examination and imaging findings, I feel that it is appropriate that we seek spine 
surgical consultation.  I am referring Ms. Smith to Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine 
surgeon, for his expert opinion.  She should continue with self-directed exercises.

He 
describes a burning and numbness.  Symptoms are chronic and he relates to me 
that he has had falls every few days with the left leg giving way.  There is no change 
to bowel or bladder functioning and no perineal numbness.  There is reported 
significant left leg weakness and difficulty performing exercises.  He has noticed 
diminished muscle mass of the left leg.  He has lower back pain at nighttime.  Mr. 
Rittenhouse says that he is scheduled to have CT and EMG investigations performed.
Review of his health history reveals that he has had prior lower back surgeries, three 
in total, including a fusion in the 1990s.  His health is otherwise good.  Mr. 
Rittenhouse is a non-smoker.  He has had his left ACL repaired.  He is retired and 
reports having difficulty completing chores at home.

left leg.  He uses a cane.  There is atrophy of the left quadriceps.  There is an 
increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+. 
Plantar responses are silent.  Power is 3+/5 of resisted left knee extension, 4+/5 of 
left knee flexion, 2+/5 of left ankle dorsiflexion and 1+/5 of the left EHL.  There is 
tenderness at the left Smith and there is a positive thigh thrust on the left.  Straight 
leg raising caused an increase in lower back pain, but not leg pain.  Femoral nerve 
stretch test was negative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There is no spasticity or 
clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 14, 2022.  From L3 to S1 images are 
non-diagnostic due to hardare artifact.  There is moderate canal stenosis at L2-3.
The physical examination is suggestive of left L3-4 radiculopathy and there appears 
to be left sacroiliac joint irritation.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that I 
follow-up with him after the CT and EMG studies.  In the interim, he could try some 
manual mobilization/manipulation to his sacroiliac joints with a physical therapist or 
chiropractor.  I have also referred him to a pain clinic for consideration of medial 
branch/facet joint blocks.

walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles 
bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Supine straight leg raising was positive on the left, along with slump 
testing.  There  is no spasticity or clonus.  There is some reduction of right hip 
internal rotation with pain reported.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign 
is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 27, 2022.  There is severe spinal canal stenosis at 
L3-4 and L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is moderate 
canal stenosis at L2-3.  There is a degenerative anterolisthesis at L4-5.  On personal 
review of the images there appears to be disc material on the left at L5-S1 
compromising the lateral recess.
Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication, and there 
are some nerve root tension signs on the left.  There are corresponding findings on 
MRI that would account for her symptoms.  Given the lack of substantive 
improvement, the reports of intermittent perineal numbness, and the affect that the 
symptoms are having on her quality of life, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with 
self-directed exercises.  She can continue with the chiropractic care if she finds 
benefit.

The symptoms 
began in 2021 with yard work and he has not experienced any significant 
improvement.  He does relate that recent injections (2 sessions) at a pain clinic have 
helped a little, but that physical therapy and chiropractic care was not helpful.  
Decompression (traction) was not helpful.  There is no change to his bowel or 
bladder functioning, and no perineal numbness.  Mr. Smith is doing a few 
exercises intermittently.  His walking and standing tolerance is less than 5 minutes 
and he has been using a walker for about 3 weeks.
Review of his health history reveals that his health is otherwise good.  He does not 
smoke and does not have any known allergies.  He has had prior appendectomy and 
tonsillectomy.  The only medication he reports taking is Gabapentin 600 mg qhs, 600 
mg qam and 300 mg qpm.

conservative care, and the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He can continue with the injections if he 
finds benefit.  Mr. Smith should be continuing with self-directed, flexion-based

The pain started about the 
left buttock in early 2022, and then at the end of July there was increasing leg pain.  
The leg pain is characterized as a sharp sensation and there is numbness into his 
foot and toes.  He is not able to get restful sleep.  Sitting is exacerbating and walking 
provides a little relief.  There has been no change to bowel or bladder functioning, 
and there is no perineal numbness.  Mr. Smith is performing self-directed 
exercises, but has not found these to be particularly helpful.  His health is otherwise 
good.  He is a non-smoker.  He has GERD for which he takes Nexium.  Mr. Smith 
works on industrial furnaces and is currently on light duties.
Medications include: Pregabalin 300 mg per day, but he has not found relief.  Other 
medications include Naproxen 500 mg bid and occasional tablet of Tylenol 3, as well 
as the Nexium.
The physical examination reveals that Mr. Smith stands 6'2"" and weighs 230 lbs.  
He stood during the history taking.  There is no antalgia.  There is an increase in 
pain with flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the left EHL 
which is 4/5.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 and S1 dermatomes.  There 
is a positive straight leg raise on the left and positive slump test.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms to suggest left L5 and possible S1 
radiculopathy.  An MRI has been requisitioned and I have recommended to him that I 
follow up with him after the study is complete.  He reported to me that he did not 
feel the Pregabalin is helping, and I suggested he speak with his physician about 
another neuromodulator, perhaps Gabapentin.  He should be continuing with 
self-directed exercises.

So I will order an urgent cervical and thoracic MRI to rule out myelopathy.
 
If myelopathy ruled out, I will plan for her posterior lumbar decompression L4-5 and I will discuss with her the risk and benefits of the surgery.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and leg (posterior thigh) pain 
which has been present for about 6 months.  She has limited walking tolerance of 5 
to 10 minutes and characterizes the pain as sharp.  She describes some urinary 
retention, but there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She has not had 
any recent physical therapies, but had some physiotherapy in the remote past for 
lower back pain.  She has attended at a pain clinic for injections without relief.  She 
is trying to perform exercises.  She was working as a cleaner but has not been able 
to return to work.
Her medical history includes essential hypertension, NIDDM, and Smith's disease.  
She has been diagnose with fibromyalgia, anemia and Smith.  She is a 
non-smoker and there are no known allergies.
She takes OTC medication for pain relief.  Other medications include: rosuvastatin 
10 mg, sitaglip/metformin 50/1000, duloxetine 60 mg, lansoprazole 60 mg, 
levothyroxine 0.088 mg.
The physical examination reveals that she walks with a slow gait.  She stands 4'10 
and weighs 62 kg. She could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Supine straight leg raising 
is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and 
non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
There is no spasticity or clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed May 11, 2022 at GNMI.  There is severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is a small 
midline disc protrusion at L5-S1 and moderate foraminal stenosis.
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  It is 
my opinion that given her functional limitation she will not be able to perform her 
pre-accident work until her condition is addressed surgically.  I have referred her for 
a spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She may wish to trial manual 
therapy with a chiro or physical therapist for her lower back pain.  A reasonable trial 
would be up to 10 sessions over a month.  She should be continuing with 
self-directed exercises.  There is no identified need for follow-up with myself and 
further comment is deferred to Dr. Smith.

Imaging findings are potentially concordant with stenosis in the concavity of degenerative scoliosis at L2-3, as well as a significant epidural midline cyst at L4-5.  We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include  continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections  And surgery  . 
 
Given her symptoms predate her current MRI, some further information is required, and I have therefore requisitioned an updated MRI as well as CT scan of the lumbar spine from GNMI.  I have also sent her for scoliosis and flexion-extension x-rays today.
 
In the meantime to further elucidate her main pain generators I would advise in staged fashion, 1) bilateral image guided L2-3 transforaminal epidural steroid injections, 2) left L4-5 image guided transforaminal epidural steroid injection, 3) multilevel facet injections plus minus ablation.  She is already seeing Mrs. The pain clinic and will get in touch with them next week for these.
 
Once she has completed the injections as well as obtain the updated imaging she knows to call my office should she not obtain adequate or durable relief from injections and we can then discuss surgical options, which would likely involve a larger operation along the lines of an L1-5 posterior decompression and instrumented fusion.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain, and pain and paresthesia 
into the left lower limb as far as the great toe.  The onset was in May 2022 and 
while conservative therapies do provide some relief, she does not indicate any 
significant improvement overall.  She notes some progressive weakness and foot 
drop of the left foot.  There is an increase in pain at night. She does find being in 
water helpful.  There is no change to bowel or bladder function, but she notes 
urinary frequency.  There is no saddle anesthesia or perineal numbness.  She has 
been prescribed exercises.  She is able to manage her ADLs, but has had to hire a 
housecleaner.
Medications for pain include: Lyrica 75 mg bid, Tramacet prn qhs, and Tramadol 200 
mg.  Other medications include: Smith, Smith, Voltaren, Synthroid and Pantaloc.
Her medical history is remarkable for SLE, hypothyroidism, Sjrogen's, and 
hypotension.  She is allergic to sulpha and codeine,  She is a non-smoker.  Prior 
surgeries include: hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and laparoscopies.
On physical examination Ms. Smith presents using a cane in her right hand.  
Bunions are noted in both feet with erythema.  Her habitus is Smith.  There 
is an increase in pain with flexion and extension of the lumbar spine.  She could not 
perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 except for left foot dorsiflexion 
which was 4+/5 and left EHL 2/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Supine straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed December 20, 2021 at Brantford General.  The 
cardinal findings are severe DDD at L2-3.  There is spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 and 
synovial cyst.  There is left L4-5 foraminal stenosis.  There is a superior disc 
extrusion at L1-2.
Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication and there are signs of left L5 
radiculopathy.  Her back pain is mechanical.  I explained to her that surgical 
intervention is more likely to help her lower extremity symptoms rather than back 
pain.  I am concerned about progressive left foot weakness and given the ongoing 
leg pain, the examination and MRI findings, and continuing impact on her quality of 
life, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I 
have also referred her to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for consideration of medial 
branch block and rhizotomy to hopefully help with her back pain.  She has found 
some relief with osteopathy and she can continue with this if she finds relief.  I have 
encouraged her to continue with self-directed exercises.

The patient understands the nature of her disease and symptoms. We discussed with the patient alternative treatments such as physiotherapy, steroid injection and conservative management. We also discussed surgical management specifically the risks, benefits and post operative expectations. The patient understands that the main goal of surgery is to stabilize/decrease saddle anesthesia and neuropathic pain. No significant improvement in foot drop is expected after surgery, due to the chronicity of this weakness. She understands that there is a small chance that surgery worsen or do not change her symptoms.

There is pain into the left great toe and numbness in the left leg.  She has significant 
weakness of the left foot and has been prescribed an AFO.  She relates incomplete 
voiding and some perineal numbness.  Ms. Smith says that the leg pain and foot 
weakness began in April.  She had some physical therapy without relief and has tried 
stretches without relief.  Her sitting and walking tolerance is reported to be 5 to 10 
minutes.  
Ms. Smith's medical history is remarkable for essential hypertension and 
dyslipidemia.  She had breast cancer about 20 years ago and had a mastectomy.  
She does not smoke and does not have any allergies.  Prior surgeries are reported 
limited to the mastectomy and hysterectomy.  Ms. Smith can only do very light 
chores at home.
Ms. Smith presented using an AFO on the left foot.  Active lumbar spine ranges of 
motion are non-provocative.  She could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power L2 to 
S1 bilaterally was graded 5/5, except for left foot dorsiflexion and EHL at 0/5.  There 
is negative straight leg raising bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal 
limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A Doppler study did not reveal any vascular insufficiency.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed May 18, 2022 and there is multilevel spinal canal and foraminal stenosis, 
worst at L4-5.  There is severe inferior L5-S1 and L4-5 foraminal stenosis, with 
significant lateral recess stenosis at L4-5, worse on the left.
Ms. Smith presents with sign and symptoms of left leg radiculopathy and foot drop.  
Given the lack of improvement in pain, motor deficit, examination and MRI findings, I 
am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. G. Guha.  She should 
continue using the AFO and perform activities to tolerance.  She does report 
incomplete bladder voiding and is also reporting some perineal numbness, and given 
this and the weakness, and I have asked Dr. Guha's office to expedite the 
consultation.  Should she experience an inability to void she should seek immediate 
medical attention.

I also sent her for flexion-extension x-rays.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and left more than right leg pain, 
described as sharp.  The onset was 2 to 3 years ago and pain is not improving.  He 
has very limited walking and standing tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  His sitting 
tolerance is 5 to 10 minutes.  Mr. Smith does not report any change to bowel or 
bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.   He 
does Aquatherapy which he finds helpful.  He has also had epidural injections which 
provided him with some relief.  He continues with self-directed exercises at home.   
He is very limited with his ability to any chores at home.
Mr. Smith's health is otherwise reported to be good, other than dyslipidemia and 
some anxiety.  He does not smoke and does not have any allergies.  He has had a 
total knee replacement on the right and partial on the left.  He has had an 
appendectomy and inguinal hernia repair.  
Medications include Tridural 100 mg qhs, Rosuvastatin 10 mg, and Escitalopram 10 
mg.
On physical examination Mr. Smith presented using a walker.  There is an anterior 
list of his torso.  An increase in pain is reported with lumbar extension.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+, except for right Achilles which is 1+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 
to S1, except for the left EHL and resisted left foot dorsiflexion which were 4/5.  
Sensation is preserved to sharp and light touch in all dermatomes.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Supine straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits and pain free.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There is no spasticity or clonus.
There is no current MRI.  A lumbar MRI was performed in 2015 which revealed 
lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and significant left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms and signs of left L5 radiculopathy and neurogenic 
claudication.  He may be a surgical candidate, but updated MRI imaging is required 
first.  I have requisitioned the MRI, but I work under medical directives here at HGH 
where the wait times can be long.  He may wish to consider discussing with his 
physician about a requisition elsewhere with shorter wait times.  Mr. Smith should 
be continuing with self-directed exercises.

intermittent paresthesia in the right foot.  The onset was insidious in November 2022 
and she reports that pain is worsening.  The pain travels as distal as the plantar 
aspect of the forefoot.  She describes a few episodes of incontinence and some 
urinary urgency, but there is no retention.  She describes some perineal numbness.  
Ms. Smith did have a course of physical therapy without relief.  She has 
been prescribes exercises which she is doing.  She has not had any injections.  She 
reports that her standing and walking tolerance is 5 to 10 minutes, and sitting is 10 
to 20 minutes. 
Medications include Gabapentin (dosage not known) and Tylenol prn.  The only other 
medication she takes is pantaloc.
Ms. Smith works as  Case Worker and is working.  She works from home 
and utilizes a sit/stand desk.
On physical examination she walks with a normal gait and there is no antalgia.  
There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  She could not perform heel and toe 
walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+, except for the left Achilles reflex which is 
1+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 except for flexor halluces on the left which is

finding is a large left L5-S1 disc herniation and significant compromise of the lateral 
recess.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a left S1 radiculopathy.  
Given the worsening of left leg dominant pain despite the passage of time, the lack 
of response to conservative care, the examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  In the interim, 
she should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

I also feel that with giving this problem some more rtime that it likely will improve and I did suggest to her to avoid excessive bending twisting turning of her back as well as considering to go to something like pool therapy and possibly if the pain pain in back and leg is not improved to consider pain clinic referral by her family doctor.,,"Ms. Smith presents with a history of lower back and left leg pain.  The lower back 
pain began with a fall in January 2022 and there was no significant leg pain at that 
time.  In March she was placed on a more strenuous job at work which involved 
repetitive lumbar flexion, and this is when the leg pain began.  Currently, the leg 
pain is worsening and she reports some urinary retention with pain, but this may be 
related to some other UTI issue.  There is no perineal numbness.  She has had 
chiropractic care for upper back and neck pain which helps, but treatment for her 
lower back (some type of supine maneuver) has not back pain.  She attends for 
physical therapy weekly consisting of dry needling and decompression (traction).  
Ms. Smith is also performing self-directed exercises at home.  She has not had any 
injections.  Ms. Smith continues to work, but has been provided with modified 
duties on a different line.
Her health is reported to be otherwise good.  She has a history of reflex syncope due 
to low blood pressure.  She does not have any known allergies and does not smoke.  
Prior surgeries include: hysterectomy (July 6, 2022), breast reduction, left ankle 
ORIF, tubal ligation and wisdom teeth removal.
Medications include: Naprosen 500 mg bid, Pregabalin 25 mg 2 tab qhs, and 
Milodrine 5 mg qid.
Ms. Smith walks with a normal gait and was not using any supports.  There is no 
antalgia.  An increase in pain was reported with lumbar flexion.  She could heel and 
toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the left EHL 
which is 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  Muscle tone 
and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is 
negative bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 17, 2022 at St. Joseph's hospital.  The cardinal 
finding is a left paracentral disc protrusion at L4-5 with abutment and minimal 
displacement of the left L5 nerve root.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a left L5 radiculopathy. There is 
corresponding finding on MRI.  She continues to be significantly impeded due to leg 
dominant pain, and has not been able to return to her regular work duties.  Given 
the leg dominant worsening pain, the examination and MRI findings, and given that it 
has been 5 months with no substantive relief with conservative care, I am referring 
Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation.  She is being referred to Dr. Smith, 
neurosurgeon.  In the interim, for her back pain she should trial up to 10 sessions of 
side posture spinal manipulation.  She should be continuing with home-based 
exercises.

For the lumbar spine I recommend active physical therapy program.
 
With respect of the cervical spine, the patient shows very mild signs of cervical myelopathy.  At most he has some mild intrinsic hand muscle weakness.  However what is concerning is the dynamic movements that cause worsening paresthesias and numbness in his hands.
 
We had a lengthy discussion today.  I would like to get an EMG study to reassess his carpal tunnel versus a C6 or C7 radiculopathy.
 
And then will have a follow-up appointment.  Clearly stated to undergo surgery will be to prevent any microinjury from dynamic movements in his cervical spine due to the significant C6-7 spinal stenosis.  One consideration could be an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and right leg pain, and 
diminished balance.  The chief complaint today however, is neck and shoulder pain, 
with a constant pressure sensation about his clavicles.  He describes diminished 
strength in his hands and occasional numbness in his fingers.  He is able to void his 
bladder and there is no saddle anesthesia.  Mr. Smith reports that his back pain 
can awaken him.  He describes leg achiness.  He works as a Construction Manager 
and is continuing to work.
His health history reveals that he has a history of depression.  Mr. Smith is a 
non-smoker.  He does not have any allergies, but does have an intolerance to 
NSAIDs.  Surgeries include: cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, and ulcer.  The only 
medication he takes for pain is Tylenol prn.  He is also taking Viibryd.
The physical examination reveals that Mr. Smith has a flattened affect.  He stands 
5'11"" and weighs 210 lbs.  His gait and cadence is normal.  Active lumbar spine 
ranges of motion are non-provocative.  He could heel and toe walk.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 
bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished at the left foot, but the distribution was 
non-dermatomal.  Vibration sense in the feet is diminished but present.  Hip ranges 
of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A cervical and lumbar MRI was performed August 27, 2022.  There is severe canal 
and foraminal stenosis at C6-7 with cord signal change.  There is degenerative disc 
changes at C5-6 and C6-7.  There are multilevel lumbar degenerative changes.  
There is severe left L5-S1 facet osteoarthritis.  There is right L4-5 foraminal 
stenosis.
Mr. Smith presents with mechanical lower back pain, and there are subtle long 
tract signs.  There is spinal cord compression at C6-7 from a combination of 
degenerative changes.  I have referred Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith.  I have also referred him to a pain clinic for consideration medial 
branch blocks and/or RF ablation of his lower lumbar spine.

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections And surgery.  We did discuss that surgery is generally not very effective for numbness alone, and given her stable and mild motor weakness, the natural history of potential improvement in her motor weakness is likely similar with or without surgery given that her weakness has been persistent since June.  She therefore elected to continue with conservative therapy however knows to call the office should there be a recurrence of her radicular pain, at which point she may require an updated MRI, and possible consideration of L5-S1 discectomy. ",,"On physical examination Ms. Smith was noted to walk with a normal gait.  An 
increase in pain was noted with lumbar flexion.  She could not perform toe walking.  
There is weakness of the right calf to repeat single leg calf raise.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally, except for the right Achilles 
which is 1+.  Power L2 to S1 bilaterally is graded 5/5, except for right EHL and FHL 
which are graded 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  There is positive 
straight leg raising on the right.  Sensation is diminished along the right L5 and S1 
dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes 
are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 3, 2022 at GNMI.  There is a large right L5-S1 
disc herniation.  There is moderate to severe right foraminal stenosis.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of right L5 and S1 radiculopathy.  
This is attributed to the large disc herniation at L5-S1.  While she has experiencing 
some improvement in the last few weeks, given the leg dominance to the pain, past 
episodes of sciatica, examination and MRI findings, I am referring her for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  In the interim, she should continue with 
self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

Consent was acquired for surgical intervention.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain and lower back pain.  The 
pain is described as being sharp in character and began in May 2020.  She has not 
experienced any significant improvement and in fact pain is worsening.  She is able 
to void her bladder.  Ms. Smith is performing exercises which she does not find 
very helpful.  She did have some chiropractic care in 202 which provided some 
temporary relief.  Her walking and standing tolerance is 5 to 10 minutes.  She 
relates to me that she has been referred for an epidural injection, but is awaiting the 
appointment to be scheduled.
Medications for pain include: Tylenol 3, 2 to 4 per day, Amitriptyline 50 mg 3 qhs, 
Gabapentin 400 mg tid.  Other medications include: venlafaxine 75 mg qhs, 
myrbetriq 50 mg OD, sertraline 25 mg 2 qhs, topiramate 100 mg bid, buspirone 1.5 
bid, and clonazepam 0.5 mg prn.
The physical examination reveals Ms. Smith walks with a normal gait.  There is no 
antalgia.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  She could heel and toe 
walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the Patellae and Achilles 
bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for mild weakness of the 
right EHL at 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished 
along the right L5 dermatome.  Straight leg raising caused neural tension bilaterally.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's signs is absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or 
spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 28, 2022.  The radiologist notes moderate 
canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is a left 
paracentral disc protrusion.  On personal review of the images the canal stenosis at 
L4-5 is fairly advanced and I would classify it as more severe.
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right leg pain.  The history and 
physical examination is consistent with right L5 radiculopathy and there is some 
unilateral neurogenic claudication.  Given the worsening of leg pain, the examination 
and MRI findings, and functional limitations, as well as failure to adequately respond 
to conservative care, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  Ms. Smith should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises and activity to tolerance.

To see whether he did a left L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection.  If he did I will asked that she goes again.  Otherwise I will send her to see Dr. Vladimir Djuric for the same LEFT L5 TFESI..
 
At least 2 injections.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back, buttock and left leg pain.  The 
pain can travel as distal as the ankle, but is usually proximal to the knee.  The onset 
was in 2020 and increased in the fall of 2021.  Pain can sometimes disturb her sleep.  
She has found some relief with chiropractic care and exercises, and she applies hot 
and cold packs at home which is helpful.  Ms. Smith has had an epidural injection 
which was not helpful.  She is taking Gabapentin 300 mg tid which is helpful.
The physical examination reveals that her gait and cadence is normal.  There is no 
antalgia.  An increase in back pain is reported with lumbar extension.  She could 
heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's 
sign is absent bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished in the left L5 dermatome.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges 
of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed April 8, 2022 at Buffalo MRI.  There is a disc bulge at 
L4-5 and severe right and moderate left foraminal stenosis at the same level.  There 
is lateral recess stenosis and encroachment upon the L4 and L5 nerve roots.  The 
cardinal finding appears to be severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms and there are signs of left L5 nerve root irritation.  
At this point, given the persisting leg dominant pain, MRI and examination results, 
failure to adequately respond to conservative care and epidural injection, and the 
significant impact that symptoms are having on her quality of life, I am referring Ms. 
Eves for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She can continue with 
chiropractic care if she finds benefit, and should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises.

numbness.  He has had lower back pain for about 20 years, and right leg symptoms

has limited standing tolerance of only about 5 to 10 minutes.  He can walk for 
distance, but develops numbness and weakness in the right lower limb.  The leg has 
sometimes collapsed on him.  Mr. Smith had his right shoulder replaced in 
December 2021 and was recovering when he fell and suffered a spiral fracture of his 
right humerus.  He is recovering from this and presented today with his right upper 
limb in a sling.
Mr. Smith's clinical presentation is commensurate with right neurogenic 
claudication.  There are signs of right L4 radiculopathy.  His back pain is mechanical 
and related to underlying degenerative changes.  A lumbar MRI was performed on 
December 16, 2020 and reveals severe canal and foraminal stenosis on the right at 
L3-4.

with a flexion-based self-directed exercise program.

about 1 year ago and pain has not improved.  She has had physical therapy without 
relief.  She is not currently performing any exercises.  Her medical history is 
unremarkable, other than a history of anxiety.  She smokes about a pack of

is corresponding finding on MRI from July 28, 2021 of a large left L4-5 disc 
protrusion.  There is degenerative disc disease at L5-S1.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of burning and numbness about the left 
anterior thigh and knee.  The onset was in November 2021.  He has had intermittent 
weakness.  He has found chiropractic manual manipulation has helped with lower 
back pain and improving mobility.  The pain has improved quite a bit with 
medication.  He is doing exercises daily.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is no nerve root tension with supine straight leg raising or with femoral nerve 
stretch.  There is no significant motor deficit other than very mild weakness of the 
left quadriceps.  
Mr. Smith says that he is scheduled for a lumbar MRI March 5, 2022.  I suspect that 
there may be a disc protrusion at L2-3 or L3-4.  I have recommended to him that I 
follow-up with him after the MRI to determine next steps.  I have encouraged 
ongoing daily performance of self-directed exercises.

The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  Her 
pain distribution is consistent with S1 dermatomal distribution, and MRI of the 
lumbar spine performed February 1, 2022 reveals a cardinal finding of disc bulging 
at L5-S1 with annular tear.  On personal review there appears to be abutment of the 
right S1 nerve root.  At L5-S1 there is lateral recess stenosis and a Grade 1 
spondylolisthesis.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain and impact on her quality of life (she cannot run 
or ski), as well as MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha. Concomitantly, I have referred her to the Mississauga 
Pain Clinic for an epidural injection to see if this may offer her at least transient 
relief.  I have encouraged her continue with self-directed exercises.

I would try to obtain three-point good fixation on each side above her previous fusion.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain, hip and lateral/anterior 
thigh pain.  She has a history of chronic lower back pain.  She fell last year and this 
aggravated lower limb symptoms.  She has a limited sitting tolerance of 5 to 10 
minutes.  She has tried chiropractic care, acupuncture and physical therapy without 
relief, and intramuscular injections have not helped significantly.  Her medical history 
is otherwise unremarkable other than hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She had 
scoliosis as a child and had Harrington Rods which were removed.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with mechanical lower back 
pain.  She has had a couple of bouts of left foot drop, but there is no significant 
weakness of the lower limbs identified today.  The pain into the hips and thighs may 
at least in part be scleratogenous type pain from the lumbo-sacral area.  Her hip 
ranges of motion were good, and there is nothing to suggest any abnormality or 
internal derangement of the hips proper.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 
3, 2021 and the cardinal finding is a Grade II L5-S1 spondylolisthesis and severe 
degenerative disc disease.  There is severe left and mild to moderate right foraminal 
stenosis.  There is a left convex lumbar scoliosis.

imaging findings of a mild L3-4 disc bulge abutting the L4 nerve root on the right side.
We had a long discussion today regarding options for her quality of life at presentation
which include continuing to live with her symptoms, multimodal medication regimen,
physical therapy, chiropractic adjustment, aqua therapy and other similar conservative
measures and injections as well as surgery.  We did have a discussion that surgical
intervention would be in the form of a minimally invasive right L3-4 foraminotomy and
possible microdiskectomy; however, given her longstanding symptoms and fairly mild
radiographic findings, although concordant, the likelihood of rapid resolution of her
pain is less, though certainly in the long term good results can be had.  She is keen to
trial an injection first and; therefore, I will make a referral to Pain Clinic for a
right L3-4 transforaminal epidural steroid injection.  Should she not obtain durable or
adequate relief from this, then she will get in touch with my office for consideration of
a right L3-4 foraminotomy and microdiskectomy.",,"Right - Negative

Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain which began about 2 years 
ago.  She has found some benefit from physical therapy and chiropractic care.  She 
describes pain through the posterior thigh, and muscle spasms at the lateral right 
leg.  There is burning sensation at the plantar aspect of the right foot.  Her health 
otherwise is good other than a history of ulcerative colitis.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is nerve root tension on the right.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 5, 2021 
which reveals right L3-4 disc herniation.
Ms. Smith is concerned about the persistence of pain and impact on her quality of 
life, including her inability to complete her chores at home.  Given this, the 
persistence of leg dominant pain, the examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have encouraged her 
to continue with self-directed exercises and she can continue with chiropractic care 
and physical therapy should she find benefit.

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include  continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections  And surgery  .  Surgery was offered in the form of an open right L5-S1 TLIF to allow a thorough decompression of the exiting L5 nerve root, though understanding that this would only help with the right L5 radicular pain and not necessarily with her calf tightness and pain or knee swelling nor significant back pain.  Because of this she would like to continue on with the pain clinic injections for now.  Should she not obtain adequate or durable relief she knows to get in touch with my office and we can revisit the surgical discussion at that time.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and right more than left leg pain.  She 
has had chronic lower back pain since 1984, but the leg pain has only been present for 
about a year.  She feels that symptoms are worsening.  She has limited standing tolerance 
of less than five minutes.  She had prolotherapy without relief.  Dr. Smith has done 
epidurals which did provide relief, but have not been as effective lately.  Recent injections 
around her coccyx area have provided relief.  She has also had laser therapy with some 
relief.
Review of her health history reveals a history of fibromyalgia and RA.  She has essential 
hypertension.  She has chronic venous insufficiency in her legs and edema.  She is 
borderline diabetic.  She is allergic to penicillin.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.  She has chronic 
coccydynia.  She has had both knees replaced and has had surgery on her feet.  She reports 
to me that she has been using a walker for about 8 years.  She is able to manage light 
chores around the home.
Medications include simpori, methotrexate, leucovorin calcium, sollifenacin, furosemide, 
irbesartan, clonidine.  For pain she is taking hydromorphone 2 mg up to 5 per day, 
hydromorph contin 3 mg - 2 per day, extra strength Tylenol 4 per day.
The physical examination reveals Ms. Smith's habitus to be endomorphic.  She was using a 
walker.  Edema is noted of her lower legs and ankles.  There is an increase in back pain with 
flexion.  Sensation is diminished in the feet in a non-dermatomal pattern.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power L2 to S1 was 5/5 bilaterally, 
except for the right EHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg 
raising is negative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
An MRI of the lumbar spine was performed at GNMI on September 15, 2022.  The cardinal 
findings are: right L4-5 synovial cyst and lateral recess stenosis.  Left L3-4 lateral recess 
stenosis, and severe right L5-S1 foraminal stenosis.
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  Given the 
worsening leg symptoms despite more conservative treatments, and in view of the MRI 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  She 
should be continuing with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

She does have severe stenosis on the MRI.  However I do not think nerve impingement is the cause of her symptoms at this point.
 
Therefore I would recommend surgical intervention at this time.
 
I recommended that she follow-up with her family doctor for consideration of referral to a pain clinic for management of her back symptoms as surgery is not effective for the treatment of these problems.
 
If there is anything I can do to further assist you in the care of this patient, please do not hesitate to contact me. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left sided lower back and posterior thigh pain.  Pain 
was previously traveling distal to the knee.  She has had lower back pain for about 5 years 
and left leg pain began in December 2021.  Ms. Smith has had physical therapy without 
significant relief.  She has had 3 acute severe flare ups of back and leg pain.  She has 
difficulty completing chores at home and navigating stairs.
Review of her medical history reveals that her health is otherwise good.  She is allergic to an 
antibiotic, but could not recall the name.  She is a non-smoker.  She has a history of OA of 
the knee, right more than left, and is awaiting an orthopedic surgical consultation.  Her 
surgical history includes having had left ACL repair, and arthroscopic procedures of both 
knees.
The physical examination reveals that Ms. Smith walks with a normal, reciprocal gait.  She 
was not using any supports.  She stands 5'0"" and weighs 150 lbs.  There is no antalgia.  
There is an increase in pain with lumbar extension.  Ms. Smith could heel and toe walk 
without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and right Achilles, but 1+ 
on the left Achilles.  Power L5 to S1 was graded 5/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+, except for diminished left biceps reflex.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed December 11, 2021 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Smith.  
There is a Grade I listhesis at L3-4 and L4-5.  There is severe canal stenosis at L4-5 and 
moderate at L2-3.  There is severe facet arthropathy at multiple levels.  There is a left L5-S1 
disc bulge and displacement of the left S1 nerve root.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of left S1 radiculopathy.  There is significant spinal 
stenosis at L4-5 and L2-3, but my impression is that her buttock and leg pain is largely 
stemming from the L5-S1 level.  Her difficulties navigating stairs may be more related to 
her knees for which she awaits a surgical consultation.  Given the ongoing left lower 
extremity pain and failure to respond to conservative care, I am referring Ms. Smith for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with 
self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

She had brief relief from injection. She is a candidate for L4-5 left decompression which would provide her relief from her leg dominant symptoms. We did also advise her in regards to infection risk especially given that she is a smoker and have advised that she quit smoking ideally. We have also obtained x-rays of the lumbar spine for pre-operative planning. 
 
We discussed complications including, but not limited to: dural tear; infection; wound complications; bleeding; injury to: major vessels, major organs; nerve root injury; weakness; numbness; bowel or bladder dysfunction; failure to improve symptoms; adjacent segment degeneration; instability; revision surgery; wrong-level surgery; blood clot; anesthesia-related risks such as pulmonary/cardiac/cerebrovascular complications, including death, paralysis and blindness.
 
We did take a look at her MRI of the cervical spine and there was no stenosis that would require operative intervention. Given her history of chiari malformation we would recommend a cranial neurosurgery consultation to determine whether that is the source of her pain. She would also benefit from a physiatry consultation in regards to her neck and upper extremity pain. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The pain is 
characterized as an ache and there is occasional sharp pain through the lower back.  There 
is numbness at the great toe.  The onset was years ago and pain is worsening.  She has 
limited walking and standing tolerance.  Physical therapy and acupuncture provided 
temporary relief.  Ms. Smith continues with yoga exercises.  She reports a secondary 
complaint of numbness and ache in the right arm.
Her medical history is remarkable only for hypothyroidism.  She has a chiari malformation.  
She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day.  There are no known allergies.  Her 
surgical history includes: right sholder, endometriosis, tubal ligation, and breast reduction.
The physical examination reveals that she walks with a normal gait.  Active lumbar spine 
ranges of motion are non-provocative.  She could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 
L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the left EHL which is graded 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished 
along the left L5 dermatome.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is 
non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+, except for sluggishness of the right triceps.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There 
are no long tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was perforemd May 19, 2022.  The cardinal finding is left L4-5 foraminal and 
lateral recess stenosis/narrowing.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing left L5 radiculopathy.  This is related 
to the lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and compromise of the L5 nerve root.  Given her failure 
to adequately respond to conservative care, functional limitations, my examination and MRI 
results, I am referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, 
she should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

Functionally she is improved as well quite a bit but she still is limited to certain degree.  She is not happy with her progress but is willing to give it another 8 weeks given the trajectory of her improvement and see how she does.  I discussed the benefits and risks of conservative versus a redo decompression versus even a TLIF and we will revisit these options in about 8 weeks time.  Thank you much for including me in her care sincerely",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock and leg pain and as distal as the web 
of the first and second digits.  The pain began in July 2022 and have not improved.  There is 
an increase in pain with walking and standing.  Lying down provides relief.  Ms. Smith does 
not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  
Exercises are not helping.  Review of her health history reveals that she had a right L4-5 
microdiskectomy in 2013 with good results.  Her health his otherwise good.  There are no 
known allergies and she does not smoke.  The only other surgery reported is tonsillectomy.  
Ms. Smith is able to manage light chores at home.
Medications include: Flexeril 10 mg and Lyrica 50 mg tid
The physical examination reveals that she walks with the aid of crutches to offload the right 
leg.  She stands 5'4"" and weighs 130 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion 
and extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ except for the right Achilles which is 1+.  
Sensation is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is positive on the right.  There is some crossover with left

It sounds like after the cervical decompression her right leg had improved.  She was having hyperreflexia and upper motor neuron type symptoms involving her trunk and legs.  Some of the symptoms have remained including tingling in her lower extremity.  I advised the patient that some of her symptoms may always remain this way since I see evidence of T2 signal change within the spinal cord in her cervical thoracic junction.
 
Her lower back pain and tightness around that area is likely from degenerative changes and will unlikely respond to surgical intervention.  What I may be able to offer, is decompression at L3-4 level to see if we could improve her leg symptoms especially triggered with ambulation.  I asked the patient if improvement in her leg only with decreased pain during walking would be enough for the patient.  She was reasonable with her expectations and was keen on proceeding with surgery.  I discussed the procedure itself including the surgery and expected recovery.
 
The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries.  No guarantees were given or implied, the patient understands that her symptoms may not significantly improve after decompression of the lumbar region. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L3-4 laminectomy.
 
My office will arrange surgery in our next available OR time.  In the meantime, to help with her back pain she could consider seeing pain clinic in the Niagara region for trigger point and/or epidural steroid injections.  This would be fairly safe and may help give her additional relief.  Over 50 minutes were spent face-to-face with the patient during today's visit.  It was a pleasure seeing  Sandra Ellen Rainville  in clinic today.  Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain and paresthesia in her legs.  
There is associated weakness.  She describes a band of tightness around her waist (this was 
present prior to cervical spine surgery July 21, 2021).  There is burning midline lower back 
pain.  Ms. Smith has sought physical therapy without relief.  As noted, she had cervical 
spine surgery in 2021 and this improved her right leg motor control issues.  There has been 
increasing left leg and foot tingling and numbness, and there is left leg paresthesia with 
walking/standing. 
Her health is reportedly otherwise good.  She is allergic to penicillin.  She does not smoke.  
She has had total right hip replacement.  She had C9-T1 decompression/fusion July 21, 
2021.  Other surgeries include c-section and breast reduction.  Ms. Smith is retired.  She 
has difficulty with chores at home.
Medications include Gabapentin 900 mg/day, Baclofen and NSAID.
Ms. Smith presented using a cane.  Her gait is slow.  She could not perform heel/toe 
walk.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally, but there is 4 
beats of clonus bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for weakness 
3+/5 of the EHLs bilaterally and to resisted left ankle dorsiflexion 4+/5.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished in the feet in a non-dermatomal pattern.  
Vibration sensation (128 hz tuning fork) was diminished in the feet.  Straight leg raising is 
non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed at Niagara Health April 29, 2022.  There is moderate to severe 
L3-4 canal stenosis.  There is left lateral recess stenosis and severe foraminal stenosis.  An 
MRI of the cervical spine was perrformed June 20, 2022.  There is focal cord signal 
abnormality at C7-T1.  There are multiple levels of foraminal stenosis.  An MRI of the 
thoracic and cervical spine was performed June 21, 2022.  There is cord compression at C7-
T1.  Thoracic spine is unremarkable. 
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms of unilateral neurogenic claudication.  There are long 
tract/pyramidal signs, but I am not certain if this is residual to her prior cervical spine 
surgery.  I have requisitioned a cervical spine MRI with contrast.  Consideration could be 
given to referring her to a pain clinic for possible medial branch/facet joint blocks.  I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  She 
should continue with activity to tolerance and self-directed exercises.

began about 1 year ago.  The pain is mostly through the posterior thighs and there is 
associated weakness and heaviness.  There are increased symptoms with walking, and relief 
with sitting.  She is able to void and there is no perineal numbness.  She does have some 
urinary urgency.  She has been attending at St. Joseph's hospital for RF ablations for her 
back which she finds helpful.  She continues with self-directed exercises.  Her walking and 
standing tolerance is less than 5 minutes.
Review of her health history reveals that she has diabetes and essential hypertension.  She 
is a non-smoker.  There are seasonal allergies.  Her surgical history includes having both 
hips replaced, and left total knee replacement.  She is able to manage chores at home.  She 
was previously swimming.  She has been using a walker for about a year.
The physical examination reveals her to be using the walker.  There is an increase in pain 
with lumbar spine extension.  She could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae adn Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 except 
for the right quadriceps which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion 
are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There 
are no long tract signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed at St. Joseph's hospital on March 24, 2022.  There is multilevel 
degenerative anterolisthesis.  There is multilevel epidural lipomatosis.  There is severe canal 
stenosis at L3-4 and severe facet OA at L4-5.  There is mild to moderate canal stenosis at L2
-3.
Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication.  This is related to the epidural 
lipomatosis.  While I am not certain given this etiology what the prognosis would be with 
any surgical intervention, nevertheless a surgical consultation is reasonable in view of her 
functional limitations.  I am referring Ms. Smith to Dr. Smith for his expert opinion.  
She should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

These injections are both diagnostic and therapeutic",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and leg pain, mostly into the 
posterior thighs, but sometimes into the lateral legs.  The symptoms are chronic but 
have worsened over time.  She reports very limited standing and walking tolerance 
of less than 5 minutes.  She has been prescribed flexion based exercises which she 
does.  Her health history includes advanced OA of the knees and she says that her 
knee surgeon will be performing knee replacement surgery, but wanted to have her 
lumbar spine addressed first.
Other than the knee OA, her health history includes dyslipidemia and essential 
hypertension.  She is allergic to Demerol.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.  She relates 
that she has never had any surgeries.
Medication for pain is Gabapentin, but this is not helping very much.  Other 
medications include: telmisartan, duloxetine, Nexium, rosuvastatin, atenolol, 
amlodipine.
The physical examination reveals her habitus to be endomorphic.  She is not using 
any supports.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  She could 
not perform heel and toe walking.  There is some non-pitting edema at the ankles 
and feet .  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is

performed July 22, 2021 reveal a convex right lumbar scoliosis and graded I 
anterolisthesis L4 on L5.

The lumbar spine itself is nontender despite diffuse high-grade paralumbar spasm there and he can marginally, erect when asked.  There is no asymmetry of diffusely poor bulk and tone in the buttocks thighs or calves with uniform areflexia at the ankles and knees, negative distracted distracted straight leg raising in the feet are well-perfused with no long tract signs.
 
Plain x-rays show diffuse oligotrophic spondylosis in good alignment and a recent MRI shows surprisingly high-grade mixed central and neuroforaminal stenosis at all levels bracketing L2-5.  There is some significant degenerative lumbar scoliosis as well. That scoliosis is very important here, we have all kinds of fluoroscopic images from his pain clinic injections going back 6 years the do not show any deformity at all, or least none to speak of.  Today's standing x-rays confirm a major dynamic instability in this man spine so in addition to decompression he will need instrumented stabilization bracketing those levels for otherwise prohibitive risk of a post decompressive instability.
 
With his wife attending of explained the problem and proposed surgical care solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues.  He is cautiously interested in going ahead to surgery but I am just as cautious and very much want him to get cardiac screening done before we would approach the operating room I will be sending him to Dr. Sebastian Rivas for that.

buttocks and posterior thighs, and he reports limited walking tolerance of 40 to 50 yards.  
The pain is chronic but worsening.  He has some relief for about 4 weeks with epidural 
injections.  He does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no 
perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.
Medications for pain include Tylenol 3 2q6hrs, and Arthrotec 50 mg bid.  Other medications 
include Smith, Symbicort, Smith, hydrochlorothiazide, pantoprazole, myrbetriq.  
His health history reveals asthma and essential hypertension.  He is a non-smoker.  There 
are no known allergies.  Mr. Smith's surgical history includes: left Smith in 2021 and he is 
scheduled for the right.  Other surgeries include: lobectomy, hernia, colonoscopy, TURP, 
and bilateral shoulder surgery.
Mr. Smith presented using a walker.  There is an anterior list of the torso.  He stands 5'6"" 
and weighs 163 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  He 
could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 
5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip ranges of motion are

There is advanced facet OA at L4-5 and also arthropathy at L3-4 and L5-S1.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  His back pain is mechanical 
and related to the degenerative scoliosis.  Given his significant functional limitations and 
the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He has also had injections at the DeGroote Pain Clinic and I recommended he 
follow-up with his interventionalist for consideration of medial branch block and/or RF 
ablation of his lumbar facets to see if this may help with his lower back pain.

Some of this may be consistent with S1 radiculopathy.  I had a long conversation with the surgery about the utility of surgery.  I explained to him that and that they are on the fence about surgical intervention.  It is possible that he had a larger disc herniation in the past that may have caused more acute sciatica.  At this point there is some evidence of ongoing healing and the nerve root is contacting the disc bulge but not being actively compressed.  That being said there may be an element of inflammation or scarring that may contribute to some of his leg pain.  If surgery were to be entertained and L5-S1 hemilaminectomy and microdiscectomy would be an option.  This is primarily to perform neurolysis and perform resection of the nucleus pulposus.  In some patients this may improve their leg pain while in others it does not help as much if the nerve itself is causing neuropathic pain in the absence of physical irritation. 
 
The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. 
 
All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning.   The patient wishes to proceed with surgery with understanding it may not help much with his pain but he would like to take the chance. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L5-S1 hemilaminectomy right sided approach with microdisectomy.  It was a pleasure seeing  Adam Donald Crane  in clinic today.  Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and posterior thigh pain.  The onset was 
a few years ago, but pain is more constant lately as of May 2022.  He does not report any 
change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  He is doing 
exercises which do not provide relief.  He has not had any formal physical therapies.  Pain 
tends to awaken him.
Medications for pain include diclofenac and lyrica.  Other medications include ramipril and 
xarelto.
His health history reveals a history of essential hypertension.  He had blood clots in his 
lungs about 6 years ago.  He smokes about a pack of cigarettes per day.  His surgical 
history includes tibial/fibular osteotomy and bilateral shoulder surgery.  He has 
environmental allergies.
The physical examination reveals him to walk with the aid of a cane.  He stands 6'0"" and 
weighs 175 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar extension.  He could not perform 
heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles 
bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
Sensation is diminished along the right L5 and S1 dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion are 
within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
There are no long tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed May 5, 2022 at St. Joseph's Hospital.  The cardinal finding is 
an L5-S1 midline and right paracentral disc protrusion.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of right S1 radiculopathy.  Given the ongoing leg pain 
and functional limitations, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am referring him for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  I have also referred him for a 
course of physical therapy at Mac2Hope clinics.  In addition, I have referred him to a pain 
clinic for consideration of epidural injection.  He should continue with self-directed 
exercises.

I recommend the patient continue with conservative measures such as nerve flossing as well as lumbar traction.  I gave her prescription for that.
 
She should try coming down on the Celebrex as well as the Lyrica further.
 
If her symptoms worsen and she like to have neurosurgical invention, please repeat MRI scan I will gladly reassess her.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and posterior thigh pain.  The onset 
was in June 2022 and she has experienced some improvement since having an epidural 
injection.  She continues to experience paresthesia in her feet .  Physical therapy has helped 
a little and there is no disruption of sleep.  There is no change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and no perineal numbness.  She is able to manage her daily activities with 
pacing.
Her medical history is remarkable for diabetes and essential hypertension.  She does not 
have any allergies.  Ms. Smith does not smoke.  She relates not having any 
surgeries.
Medication for pain is limited to Pregabalin 100 mg qhs at this point.  She was previously 
taking Smith and Celecoxib.  Other medications include: Jardiance 25 mg, Janumet 
1000/100 mg, Glicazide MR 30 mg, Coversyl 8 mg, Simvastatin 5 mg.
On physical examination Ms. Smith was observed to walk with a normal, reciprocal 
gait.  She was not using any supports.  She stands 5'2"" and weighs 125 lbs.  She could heel 
and toe walk without difficulty and there were no balance issues.  Power was graded 5/5 L2 
to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There is 
no spasticity or clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed September 7, 2022 at GNMI.  The images reveal severe spinal 
canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is moderate to 
severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally at L4-5 and L5-S1.
Ms. Smith presents with buttock and posterior thigh pain, along with paresthesia in 
her feet.  She has experienced some improvement since having an epidural injection the 
beginning of September.  Her symptoms are commensurate with neurogenic claudication 
and there are MRI findings to account for this.  We had a long discussion about next steps.  
Given that her symptoms only seemed to have improved with the epidural and with 
Pregabalin, as well as the imaging findings, and concern regarding deterioration in her 
functioning, I am referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the 
interim, she should continue with flexion-based exercises and activity to tolerance.

We did offer surgical intervention in the form of an L3-4 laminectomy for decompression of the nerve and possible resection of the cystic lesion.  We discussed that if the lesion was in fact coming from the covering of the nerve then we would not be resecting it as this would put him at risk of spinal fluid leak.

We discussed indications and risks of the procedure including but not limited to injury to spinal nerves, CSF leak, lack of improvement in symptoms, bleeding, infection, possible redo operation, as well as risks of general anesthetic.  He weighed all of his options as was more interested in pursuing epidural steroid injections initially and he would think about surgery.  We will refer him to the Bloor pain clinic for left L3-4 transforaminal epidural steroid injections. ",,"Mr. Smith was seen initially September 30, 2022.  He reported left buttock, thigh and 
lateral knee pain.  The onset was in early August with lifting.  He has had physical therapy 
and chiropractic care without relief.  He is able to get restful sleep.  His health history is only 
remarkable for epilepsy.  Mr. Smith is a non-smoker.  He is limited in his ability to do 
chores at home.
The physical examination reveals that he stands 183 cm and weighs 87 kg.  His gait and 
cadence is normal.  There is an increase in pain with flexion.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+.  
Power is 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left, and there is some 
crossover with right SLR.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  I noted that 
a lumbar MRI was performed at GNMI on September 20, 2022.  There is a left L3-4 T2 
enhancing lesion in the lateral recess.  The radiologist provides differentials of possible 
nerve sheath tumour or synovial cyst.  On personal review of the images I felt it may be disc 
material with atypical enhancement given the history of onset.  Mr. Smith was diagnosed 
wtih left leg radicular symptoms with L4 nerve root involvement.  An MRI with contrast was 
requisitioned and I was to follow up with him post MRI.  I encouraged him to continue with 
self-directed exercises.
On follow-up today Mr. Smith says that his pain remains the same.  There continues to be 
left buttock and left thigh pain to the lateral knee, and some pain in the leg.  As noted, he 
has not experienced any significant relief with conservative management.  He is able to get 
restorative sleep.  He estimated having experienced 20 to 25% improvement.  He is not 
taking any pain relieving medication.
The MRI with contrast was performed October 11, 2022.  The radiologist notes the T2 
hyperintense lesion at L3-4, but favours within differentials an extruded disc.  This fits with 
the history and my impression.
At this point, given the limited improvement, functional limitations, and imaging findings, I 
am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He should 
continue with exercises and activity to tolerance.

Clinically I would have expected this to be more along an L4 nerve root distribution.  However, based on imaging it relieve the L5 nerve root on the left side is involved.  There appears to be a broad base disc herniation resulting in lateral recess stenosis at L5.  This accounts well for his chronic and waxing/waning symptoms.  Overall his quality of life is impacted and he feels that the leg pain takes a significant portion his overall discomfort. 
 
We discussed surgical options for this in the form of an L4-5 Hemilaminectomy and microdiscectomy.  The primary goal of surgery is to decompress the nerve root and help alleviate his leg pain.  It may not make a dramatic impact to his low back pain. The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L4-5 hemilaminectomy and microdiscectomy with left-sided approach.
 
The patient has been placed on the elective list for a future surgical date.  If his symptoms improve in the meantime he can call my office to take himself off of the surgical wait list.  I also recommended that he give gabapentin or pregabalin to try to see if this will help with his symptoms.

Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient.",Not had Sx yet,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back, left buttock and leg (posterior thigh) 
pain.  The onset was a couple of years ago, but much more intense over the past year.  
There is no report of any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and no perineal 
numbness.  Physical therapy and chiropractic care have provided only very transient relief.  
He is continuing with stretching exercises.  Mr. Smith says that he had an epidural 
injection about 3 days ago and it seems to have provided some relief.  
Mr. Smith is not taking any medications.  His health in general is good.  He does not have 
any known allergies.  He is a non-smoker.  The only surgery he reports having had was a 
tonsillectomy.  He works in construction and is working modified with no heavy lifting.
The physical examination reveals that his gait and cadence is normal.  He was not using any 
supports.  He stands 6'1"" and weighs 200 lbs.  Active lumbar ranges of motion were non-
provocative.  He could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ 
at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg 
raising is non-provocative and Smith's test did not precipitate any increase in leg pain.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign 
is absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed November 29, 2021 at Niagara General.  There is a left L4-5 
disc protrusion with compromise of the left lateral recess and what appears to be 
displacement of the left L5 nerve root.
Mr. Smith has symptoms consistent with left L5 nerve root irritation.  Given the 
unremitting pain which has not responded to conservative care and the passage of time, as 
well as the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue with self-directed exercises.

329,329,736,2022-10-03 00:00:00,Yes,No,No,0,1,329,6,0.0,0.0,1.0,"I spent quite some time with this complaint and follow explaining the generally benign nature of his MRI and showing him the scan explaining what the anatomy is.  The only potential source of trouble is the dehydrated lumbosacral disc but even that does not look so bad in terms of inflammatory changes surrounding it and I should recall for everybody that the scan goes back to last April presenting today he is telling me that for just 2weeks ""my legs do not feel so good"".  I really do not know what that means.
 
Prognosis here is poor with any kind of surgical care the gentleman obviously has a massive component of symptom amplification and furthermore has a compensation related complaint, I have heard multiple times that ""compensation will not help cut out that they denied me… I have money no money to live anywhere… I am living on a driveway…"" Etc. etc.
 
When all was said and done I learned that he is got plans to fly back to British Columbia for some reason just on December 8, I do not expect we will be able to get any update MRI imaging that might explain his acuity and that kind of a timeframe at all and I spent quite some time suggesting he go into his local ER in BC to follow-up for care but he is asked me to try to put an order in for an MRI here and is claims he be willing to come back to it despite the fact that he does not have any money.
 
I am greatly challenged here by the social situation.
 
Best I can offer is to put in a requisition for an update MRI scan which I am happy to do.  I have told him that but again explained I think it be much better off going into his local emergency room to seek care in the environment where he is going to be for the next little while.
 
If he gets the scan done here I will look forward to reviewing it with him further when he comes to me.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock pain and into the posterior thigh. 
 The onset was about 2 years ago, and he has had several lower back injuries.  He relates 
that his pain is worsening and he has not been able to return to his work as a Diesel 
Mechanic for several months.  Exercises have not been particularly helpful.  There is no 
change to bowel or bladder functioning, and no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  
The medical history is reported to be otherwise good.  He is a smoker.  There are no known 
allergies.  He has had ORIF of the right arm.
Mr. Smith walks with a limp favouring the right leg.  He is using a back support.  He stands 
6'0"" and weighs 185 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  He could heel 
and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles 
bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished along the right S1 dermatome.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 
to S1 bilaterally, except for the left FHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical. 
 Straight leg raising is positive on the right.  Slump testing is positive on the right.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed April 9, 2022 at St. Catharines General.  The cardinal finding is 
a right L5-S1 disc herniation with abutment of the right S1 nerve root.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a right S1 radiculopathy.  His symptoms 
have not improved with time and have prevented him from returning to work.  In view of 
this, the examination and MRI findings, I am referring him for a spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue with self-directed exercises.

Ms. Smith has left leg radicular symptoms and unilateral neurogenic claudication.  It is my 
impression that this is related to the lateral recess stenosis at L5-S1 and L4-5.  Given the 
lack of substantive improvement despite the passage of time and the examination findings, 
I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, 
she should continue with self-directed exercises, and physical therapy and chiropractic care 
if she finds it helpful.

limited standing and walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes. The onset was insidious in 
March 2022 and he has not experienced any significant relief.  This is despite attending for 
physical therapy.  Epidural injections (2) provided relief for about a month.  Mr. Smith says 
his sleep is disturbed due to lower back pain.  He is very limited in his ability to perform 
chores at home.
Medications include Tylenol 600 mg OD, Tramadol bid, and Gabapentin 400 mg tid.  His 
health is otherwise good.  He relates that he a minor stroke in July 2022 and was on blood 
thinners for a short time, but is no longer on them.  Mr. Smith is a non-smoker.  The only

Mr. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  He has 
very limited functioning and walking/standing tolerance.  He uses a cane and has a walker 
at home.  The MRI reveals severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and physical therapy has not helped 
very much in improving his functioning.  I therefore am referring Mr. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  In the interim, he 
should be continuing with flexion-based exercises.

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include continuing to live with symptoms, following up with her pain clinic referral, or surgical management, which was offered in the form of a T12 kyphoplasty. She has an upcoming trip to Serbia and would like to continue to live with her symptoms at this time. Should she change her mind and wish to pursue surgery, we can revisit her case at that time. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was as a result of a 
fall in the summer of 2021.  She has experienced improvement and estimates it at 50%.  She 
has not had any physical therapies, but did have injections (intramuscular?) in Serbia which 
helped.  There tends to be an increase in pain with transitioning from lying down to 
standing.  There is no change to bowel or bladder functioning, and no perineal numbness.  
Ms. Smith reports to me that she is scheduled to have a bone mineral density study this 
week.
Ms. Smith is not taking any pain relieving medications.  She is taking clonazepam and 
citralopram.  She has a history of depression and is pre-diabetic, but her health his 
otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker and does not have any known allergies.  The only 
surgery she reports having had was to her hand.  She has difficulty with bending and 
performing chores at home.
Ms. Smith stands 175 cm and weighs 90 kg.  Her gait and cadence is normal.  There is 
no antalgia.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  She could heel and toe walk 
without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles 
bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  There are no long 
tract/pyramidal signs.
Plain film radiographs of the lumbar spine were performed July 4, 2021.  There is a 
compression fracture of T12 of uncertain age.
Ms. Smith is status post T12 compression fracture.  She has mechanical lower back pain.  
Up to date xrays were performed today and there is progression of the compression 
fracture and marked wedging at T12.  Notwithstanding that more than a year  has elapsed 
since her fall, I feel it reasonable that we obtain an opinion as to whether she may be a 
candidate for kyphoplasty.  I am referring her for Dr. D. Guha.  Concomitantly, I am referring 
her to a pain clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet joint blocks to see if this may 
help with her back pain.  She should be continuing with self-directed exercises.  She could 
consider gentle spinal mobilization to the lower lumbar spine on a trial basis of perhaps 6 
to 8 sessions over a month.  The results of the bone mineral density study will be of help to 
Dr. Guha in his clinical decision making.

preserved bilaterally.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are 
within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ with negative Hoffmann sign bilaterally.  
There is no spasticity or clonus.
Lumbar MRI was performed August 26, 2022 at Brantford General Hospital.  There is left 
lateral recess and foraminal stenosis at L4-5 and foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  There is 
significant foraminal stenosis on the left at both levels.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing left thigh and radicular symptoms 
from L5 nerve root irritation.  There is no significant motor deficit.  At this point in time 
given the persistence of symptoms, I am referring him for a surgical consultation with Dr. 
Smith, neurosurgeon.  He could trial manual spinal mobilization therapy and 
consideration could also be given to referring him for an epidural injection which may 
proffer him some relief.  Mr. Smith should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

The onset was in 
January 2022 and pain is worsening.  There are no changes to bowel or bladder functioning, 
and no perineal numbness.  She had an epidural injection August 17, 2022 with no relief.  
She has been prescribed exercises which are not helping much.  She had a prior history of 
right sided sciatica in the past which resolved.  Her medical history reveals a history of 
addiction to pain relievers.  She is an ex smoker.  She has seasonal allergies.  Her surgical 
history includes breast augmentation and liposuction.  She was working as a PSW but has 
not been able to return to work.  She cannot complete her chores at home.

Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of a left S1 radiculopathy.  An MRI performed at GNMI 
on February 26, 2022 reveals a cardinal finding of a left L5-S1 disc protrusion.  Given the

This is not a good situation to be in correctional surgery would be a massive and very high risk for catastrophe a couple of different ways.

I think I can spare the lumbosacral joint and I need to go all the way up to L5.
 
We talked at some length about the magnitude of this intervention and the considerable risks attached to it including death and paralysis which are very real things in a case like this.  Honestly am not enthusiastic about it, it will be a massive surgery in a very large man like this.  I reiterated to them that I see nothing here that is immediately threatening paralysis or other neurological catastrophe but he is dead set on ""I cannot live like this"" and wants me to look at going ahead to surgery.
 
Upfront I have to to tell him that his risk for silent end-stage cardiac disease is enormous by his risk factor profile and enforced inactivity so I very much want him to have cardiac screening done before we would look at going anywhere close to an operating room.

Other medications include: 
Duloxetine 90 mb OD, Amlodipine 5 mg HS, Gabapentin 900 mg tid, and Aripiprazole 2 mg 
OD.
Review of the health history reveals that Mr. Smith has essential hypertension and 
compassion fatigue.  He does not have any allergies.  He is a non-smoker.  His surgical 
history includes: left lung tumor removal, left Smith and Smith, left ankle surgery, 
cholecystectomy and appendectomy.
The physical examination reveals that Mr. Smith is endomorphic.  His gait reveals mild left 
foot drop.  Active lumbar spine ranges of motion are non-provocative.  He could not 
perform heel walking on the left.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and 2+ at 
the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1, except for the left EHL 4/5 and

degenerative changes.  There is a left convex scoliotic curve and advanced facet joint 
arthropathy in the lower lumbar spine.  There is left lateral recess stenosis at L4-5.
Mr. Smith presents with mechanical lower back pain related to the degenerative scoliosis 
and facet joint degeneration.  There are signs of left L5 radiculopathy.  The symptoms into 
the buttocks and posterior thighs is neurogenic or possibly scleratogenous from the 
degenerative changes.  At this point, given the significant impact on his functioning and 
quality of life that pain is having, and notwithstanding the back dominance of the pain, but 
in view of imaging findings, I think it reasonable that we obtain a spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  Concomitantly, I have referred Mr. Smith to a pain clinic 
for consideration of medial branch blocks and/or rhizotomy.   I have encouraged Mr. 
Smith to continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.  He cannot walk 
for distance but may wish to try cycling.  Weight loss is encouraged.  I recommend blood 
testing for fasting glucose, TSH and B12 levels.  Consideration could be given to an AFO for 
the left foot drop.

I think this patient has a mixed picture.  But I think most of the symptoms are coming from the L3-4 stenosis / disc.  And not the L5-S1 foraminal stenosis.  He does not describe any pain radiating to his foot or ankle or anywhere below his knee.  Certain element of claudication as well as an element of L4 possibly L3 radicular leg symptoms
 
Hence I gave a prescription today to give to his pain doctor to do left-sided L4 and L3 transforaminal epidural steroid injections.  After he had those injections done he will contact my office",,"Mr. Smith presents with a history of back, buttock and proximal thigh pain.  The majority 
of his pain is in the buttocks, mostly left.  He can no longer run due to his symptoms.  The 
onset of symptoms was about 1 year ago and is worsening.  There is no urinary retention or 
perineal numbness, but there is some bowel urgency.  He tried chiropractic care without 
relief and continues with self directed exercises.  He works as an Air Traffic Controller and 
continues to work.
Mr. Smith is taking Advil 1600 mg per day for pain relief.  Other medications include 
ezetimibe, ticagrelor, and esomeprazole.  His health history includes having a cardiac stent 
implanted.  He has environment allergies.  He does not smoke.  He has a histoyr of labral 
tear of the right hip.  His surgical history includes ACL repair and septoplasty, in addition to 
the cardiac stent.
Mr. Smith stands 6'0"" and weighs 200 lbs.  His gait and cadence is normal.  There was no 
antalgia.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  Mr. Smith could heel 
and tow walk without difficulty.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion were within normal limits.  There is a 
positive FADIR test on the right.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  
Straight leg raising on the left caused left buttock pain.  Right SLR is unremarkable.  There is 
tenderness at the lumbo-sacral junction and over the superior gluteal musculature.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 15, 2022 at GNMI.  There is moderate to severe L3-4 
canal stenosis from a combination of degenerative changes.  It is my opinion that the 
cardinal finding may be in fact the L5-S1 level where there is disc degeneration and severe 
bilateral foraminal stenosis.  There is also a retrolisthesis at this same level.
Mr. Smith has predominantly buttock and sometimes pain into the proximal thighs, worse 
on the left.  His symptoms are not typical for neurogenic claudication.  Rather, I believe that 
his symptoms may in fact be stemming from the L5-S1 level and L5 nerve root irritation.  
Given the worsening pain, lack of response to chiropractic care and exercises, and imaging 
findings, I am referring him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  
I have recommended that he continue with flexion based exercises.  I have also referred him 
to a pain clinic for consideration of transforaminal epidural injection and possible medial 
branch blocks.

The surgical option here would be a L3-5 laminectomy and decompression.  This will need to be bilateral since his central canal is quite tight and it is compressed on both sides. 
 
The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for 3 4, L4-5 laminectomy for bilateral decompression.

started as lower back pain about a year ago and the left leg pain has been present for a 
couple of months.  She has not experienced any significant improvement, and in fact 
reports pain is worsening.  She does not report any change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She has tried physical 
therapies, chiropractic care, massage and acupuncture without relief.  She has had recent 
intramuscular injection without relief, and is scheduled for epidural injection in December.  
She is not performing any exercises.  She cannot work and can only do very light chores at 
home.
Medication for pain includes: Pregabalin 50 mg qhs and Tylenol 2 1 q6h.  Her health is 
reported to be otherwise good.  She is allergic to gluten.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of 
cigarettes per day.  The only surgery she reports having had was a c-section.
The physical examination reveals that she walks with a limp favouring her left leg and was 
in very obvious physical distress.  She sat antalgic to the right.  There is an increase in pain 
with flexion and extension of the lumbar spine.  She could heel and toe walk.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and right Achilles, but 1+ on the left.  Power is graded 
5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for left FHL which is 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along the 
left S1 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 22, 2022 at KMH.  There is a very large L5-S1 more 
prominent on the left side but filling most of the spinal canal and some possible 
compromise of the sacral nerve roots.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of worsening left S1 radiculopathy.  Given the disabling 
nature of her worsening pain, examination and imaging findings, I am referring her for 
spine surgical consultation.  Fortunately, Dr. Smith was in the clinic today and agreed to 
see her.  Further comment is deferred to Dr. Smith's consultation.  Ms. Smith should be 
performing activities to tolerance.  She asked me about medications and I recommended 
she consult with her physician about possibly increasing the dose of the Pregabalin, and 
perhaps a tricyclic such as Smith to help her sleep.

 L2 to S1, except for the right FHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
Straight leg raising is positive on the right.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There are no long 
tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed in St. Catharines on May 16, 2022.  The cardinal finding is a 
right L5-S1 disc herniation with displacement and compression of the right S1 nerve root.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of a right S1 radiculopathy.  There is corresponding 
finding on imaging.  Given the persisting leg dominant pain, and the impact on his quality 
of life, as well as limited response to conservative care and imaging findings, I am referring 
him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He should be continuing with self-
directed exercises.

Symptoms are significantly affecting quality of life. 
 
The patient understands the nature of his disease and symptoms. 
 
We discussed with the patient alternative treatments such as physiotherapy, steroid injection and conservative management. We also discussed surgical management specifically the risks, benefits and post operative expectations . 
 
The patient understands the risks inherent to anesthesia including (but not limited) to death, stroke, blindness and aspiration pneumonia.
 
The patient understands the risks specific to the procedure (but not limited) to permanent or temporary paraparesis or paresthesias as well as urinary and fecal incontinence. Patient understands that there is a risk of infection, bleeding, dural tear and need for subsequent surgeries.
 
The patient understands that the main goal of surgery is to stabilize/decrease neurogenic pain. He understands that there is a small chance that surgery worsen or do not change his symptoms.

Based on imaging summary the L5 nerve root that potentially has surgical pathology.  I am somewhat on the fence about how effective surgery may be given that the L4-5 disc protrusion did not look all that impressive.  Conversely the L5-S1 far lateral disc would require an instrumentation and fusion procedure which is more invasive and and requires longer recovery. 
 
I explained surgery in detail to the patient and walked him through my thought process.  The patient has not tried any gabapentin or Lyrica in the past.  He is amenable to this.  As such I am giving him a prescription for Lyrica 75 mg p.o. twice daily to try.  The patient would like to still entertain the surgical option despite the uncertainty regarding the extent of pain relief he may receive. 
 
The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L45 hemilaminectomy left-sided approach with possible microdiscectomy.
 
The patient will give Lyrica a try first.  If his pain significantly improves then we can defer surgery.  However if he finds that the pain relief still it is not adequate and we can continue to keep the midline for next available elective OR time.

care and time, the examination and imaging findings, I am referring him for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  I have also referred him for epidural injection 
to see if this may proffer him some relief.  He should continue with self-directed exercises.

concent singed by the patient.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left leg pain.  The pain began about 7 
months ago and has not improved despite a course of physical therapy.  The pain travels as 
distal as the foot and toes and is characterized as sharp.  He does not report any change to 
bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  The medical history 
reveals depression and essential hypertension.  There are no known allergies.  He is quitting 
smoking and is down to only one or two cigarettes per day.  He is awaiting a left knee 
replacement.  The surgical history includes right Achilles repair, and arthroscopes of the left 
knee.
Medications include: Advil xtra strength 4 to 6 per day, Smith 10 mg qhs, and 
Venlafaxine.
The physical examination reveals a reciprocal gait with no noticeable limp.  He stands 5'10 
and weighs 184 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  He could heel and toe 
walk.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is 
diminished along the left S1 dermatome.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Straight 
leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+. Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There is markedly enlarged left 
knee joint with tenderness at joint lines.

herniation with impingement of the traversing left S1 nerve root.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of left S1 radiculopathy, which is not improving 
despite conservative care.  Given the left dominance to his pain, the examination and 
imaging findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to 
tolerance.

We had a lengthy discussion.  As I clearly stated to him, with a painless foot drop surgical intervention may give a 50-50 chance of improving right-sided foot drop.
 
If we did surgery we may have to consider doing a posterior decompression at the L3-4 level as well as the L4-5 level and opening up the right L4-5 foramina with a right L4-5 discectomy.  Based on the looking at the facet joints and the L4-5 listhesis, we may have to put screws from L3-L5

occasional shooting pain.  He also has lower back pain.  He reports that he has had right 
foot drop since April.  He does not report any change to his bowel or bladder control and 
there is no saddle anesthesia or any perineal numbness.  There tends to be an increase in 
right leg pain with walking and standing and relieved with sitting.  He is not currently taking 
any pain relieving medications.  The only medication he takes is perindopril for 
hypertension.  His walking and standing tolerance is 5 to 10 minutes.
Other than the hypertension his health is reportedly good.  He does not have any known 
allergies and is a non-smoker.  Surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and surgery to 
the right shoulder.  He works as a police officer but is currently working light duties.  He is 
scheduled to retire next June.
On physical examination Mr. Smith presents with a normal gait and was not using any 
supports.  He stands 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 245 pounds.  There was an increase in 
pain with lumbar spine extension.  He could not perform heel and toe walking.  Reflexes are 
1+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 except for the right foot 
dorsiflexion and EHL which were both 4/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation 
is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits 
and upper limb reflexes are 2+ with negative Hoffmann sign bilaterally.
An EMG was performed August 19, 2022 and this reveals a right L5-S1 radiculopathy.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed September 13, 2022 and this reveals moderate canal stenosis at 
L3-4 with severe facet osteoarthritis at L4-5 and moderate to severe left and moderate right 
foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  There is severe right foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  There is 
advanced degenerative disc disease and Modic changes at L5-S1.  There is lateral recess 
stenosis on the right at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing right sided neurogenic 
claudication and a progressive foot drop.  Given the progression of the foot drop and 
concern for worsening, as well as limited walking and standing tolerance, I am referring him 
for a surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Mr. Smith could consider a course of  
manual physical therapy for his lower back to address any lower back pain.  He should

Patient will contact my office next week to see what the x-ray shows thank you",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of leg pain/burning/heaviness, worse on the right than 
the left.  The symptoms began about a year ago and are worsening.  There is an increase in 
pain with walking and standing and he reports that his walking tolerance is limited to about 
100 yards before he has to sit.  Symptoms are relieved after few minutes of sitting and he 
can continue.  He does not report any change to his bowel or bladder functioning and there 
is no saddle anesthesia or any perineal numbness.  He reports that he is able to get 
restorative sleep.  He continues to attend for chiropractic care on a monthly basis but 
without any significant relief.
Medication includes tramadol 3 to 4 tablets/day.  Other medications include Crestor and 
meloxicam.
Review of his general health reveals that his health is otherwise good.  He does have a 
dyslipidemia.  He has osteoarthritis of the right knee.  He does not have any known allergies 
and he does not smoke.  Prior surgeries include to the left index finger and a vasectomy.  
He is able to manage his chores at home.
On physical examination Mr. Smith was observed to walk with a normal gait.  He was using 
a cane with a seat.  He stands 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 190 pounds.  There is an increase 
in pain with lumbar spine extension.  Flexion is relieving.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at 
the patella and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  
Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg 
raising is negative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+. Hoffmann sign is negative bilaterally.
A lumbar spine MRI was performed June 7, 2022 at GN MRI.  This reveals a cardinal finding 
of severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There 
is severe degenerative disc disc disease at L5-S1 with facet incompetence also noted at L4-
5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith has symptoms commensurate with neurogenic 
claudication.  There are corresponding findings on MRI.  Given his significant functional 
limitations I am referring him for surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  
Flexion-extension studies performed were performed today.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith 
to continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

He does have osteoarthritis of his knees.  There are no known allergies.  He does not 
smoke.  He has had prior rotator cuff surgery on the right as well as right knee surgery.  
Medications include ezetimibe and Crestor.  Mr. Smith is retired and is limited with his 
ability to perform activities of daily living.  He is able to golf if he uses a cart.
Mr. Smith stands 6 feet 1 inches and weighs 214 pounds.  His gait and cadence was

extension.  He could not perform toe walking.  Reflexes are 2+ at the patella and Achilles

A lumbar MRI was performed at GMI on July 22, 2022.  This reveals severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5 and moderate to severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  
There is a disc bulge at L4-5 but on personal review it was more of a herniation after I 
looked at the images.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms that are commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  
At this point in time given his failure to respond to conservative measures, the significant 
limitation in walking and standing, with tolerance of less than 5 minutes, as well as the 
imaging findings, I am referring him on for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  In 
the interim he should continue with flexion-based exercises and activity to tolerance.

The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L4-5 bilateral laminectomy.

sustained activity.  She does not report any change to her bowel or bladder functioning and 
there is no saddle anesthesia or any perineal numbness.  She has tried physical therapy, 
chiropractic care and acupuncture without relief.  She has also had injections without relief.  
She had an epidural injection last week which provided her with about a day of relief.  Back 
pain can sometimes disturb her sleep.
Medications include gabapentin and baclofen.  Other medications include Fiorinal and 
Imitrex as needed.
Review of her medical history reveals a history of migraine headaches.  She does not have 
any allergies.  She is a non-smoker.  Her surgical history includes 2 C-sections 
bunionectomy, abdominal plasty, and a facelift.
Ms. Smith is able to manage chores at home.

Mr. Smith is continuing to have left S1 radicular symptoms although there is no 
significant motor deficit on examination today.  The symptoms are continuing to 
significantly impact on his quality of life.  As such, and in consideration of the MRI findings, 
I am referring him for surgical opinion with Dr.Smith, neurosurgeon.  He should continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.  He can continue with the chiropractic 
care if he finds benefit.

Her MRI is consistent with severe L3-4 canal stenosis and left L4-5 foraminal stenosis. The patient's clincal exam and history are not entirely consistent with typical neurogenic claudication, however, we cannot entirely exclude a contribution from this to her current symptoms. 
 
Our differential for her current presentation includes a left L5 radiculopathy with a possible component of sacroiliitus or right sided hip osteoarthritis, given the deep right groin pain. In order to further characterize this, we will be ordering same day X-rays of the spine and hip --> upon review, these do reveal moderate arthrosis of the right hip.
 
Given the uncertainty of the etiology of her symptoms. We recommend a referral to a pain clinic for diagnostic and therapeutic considerations, and she would like to pursue an option closer to home, therefore I will leave this in the hands of her family physician. Given the XR findings today I would recommend image-guided injections targeting the right SI joint and subsequently intraarticular into the right hip, to help provide further diagnostic clarity. Should these not provide her with adequate or durable relief, she knows to contact my office to revisit the idea of lumbar decompression. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a history of leg pain, left more than right, which began about a 
year and a half ago.  There was worsening pain to the feet and an increase in pain with 
walking.  More recently she has experienced marked improvement with medication 
including Toradol and pregabalin but dosages are not known.  She is performing exercises 
and yoga which helps a little.  She has not had any formal physical therapies.  She does not 
report any urinary retention and there is no perineal numbness.  She is able to manage 
chores at home.
A review of her medical history reveals that she was in a recent motor vehicle accident 
which exacerbated back pain.  She has a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism.  More 
recently she has has swollen lymph nodes at her mandibular angle and this is being further 
investigated.  She has seasonal allergies.  She smokes about a pack of cigarettes per day.
Medications include an antihypertensive and thyroid medication as well as a PPI, but she 
could not recall the names.  She also takes hydrochlorothiazide.
Ms. Smith is Smith.  Her gait and cadence is normal and she was not using any 
supports.  She could not perform heel walking.  There was an increase in pain with lumbar 
spine extension.  Toe walking could be performed without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes 
are 1+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1 except for the left 
EHL which is mildly weak at 4+/5.  There is diminished sensation along the left L5 
dermatome.  Straight leg raising is not provocative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are 
within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is negative Hoffmann sign 
bilaterally.  There are no long tract signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 5, 2022 at GMI.  There is a severe canal stenosis at L3-
4 and moderate at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is moderate to 
severe left foraminal stenosis at L4-5.
My clinical impression is Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication related to the 
spinal stenosis.  She is concerned about being on medications and the effect on her liver 
longer-term.  She did try to titrate down on the pain relieving medications but her 
symptoms increased.  Therefore I am referring her on for a spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. D. Guha.  Pending this consultation she may wish to trial some physical therapy and she 
should be continuing with self-directed flexion-based exercises.  I have recommended that 
she follow-up with the advanced practice professional in the community for exercise review.

numbness and heaviness with walking.  There is increased symptoms with walking and 
standing and relieved with lying down.  She is able to get restful sleep for the most part.  
She does not report any change to her bowel or bladder functioning and there is no 
perineal numbness or any saddle anesthesia.  She has attended for physical therapy and 
acupuncture on a weekly basis but is not certain if it is helping.  She does attended a gym 
facility.
Medications include gabapentin 100 mg 3 times daily and Toradol as needed.  Other 
medications include EstroGel, progesterone, zopiclone, and Smith for lupus.
Review of her medical history reveals a history of lupus.  She is allergic to sulfa and has 
seasonal allergies.  She does not smoke.  Her surgical history includes C-section and surgery 
for a parathyroid tumor as well as melanoma on her face.  She reports difficulty with 
completing chores at home due to her limited functioning in walking and standing.
Physical examination reveals that her gait and cadence is normal and she was not using any 
supports.  She stands 5 feet with 115 pounds.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar 
spine extension.  She could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Reflexes are 2+ at the 
patella and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical and sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is not 
provocative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes 
are 2+ with negative Hoffmann sign bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed at GMI on June 18, 2022.  This reveals severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L4-5 and mild at L5-S1.  There is left-sided L4-5 foraminal stenosis. There is a 
grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L4-5.
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  She is 
severely stenotic at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  Given this and the 
lack of significant improvement in functioning despite conservative measures and the 
passage of time, I am referring her for a spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  
Standing plain film radiographs of the lumbar spine were performed today in preparation

require any stenting.  She has a history of osteoarthritis and asthma.  She had lumbar spine 
fusion surgery in 2008 with Dr. Smith.  She has paresthesia through the left hand.  She has 
allergies including environmental allergies and to mold.  She does not smoke.  Her surgical 
history includes otherwise hysterectomy and tonsillectomy.  She has significant difficulty 
with her activities of daily living and has been using a walker.
On physical examination her habitus is endomorphic.  She was using a walker to help her 
ambulate.  There is an anterior list of her torso.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar 
spine extension.  Reflexes are 2+ at the patella and Achilles.  Power is graded 5/5 except for 
the left EHL which is 3+/5 and to resisted left foot dorsiflexion is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  Slump and 
straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman sign is negative bilaterally.
A CT of the lumbar spine was performed June 6, 2022 and reveals severe foraminal stenosis 
at L5-S1.  Extensive lumbar hardware is noted.  On personal review there is appear apparent 
failure of lumbosacral hardware.  There is extensive vacuum phenomenon of the L5-S1 disc. 
 The spinal canal could not be adequately visualized due to hardware artifact, but it is 
apparent that there is fairly significant foraminal stenosis, more so on the left.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing left L5 radiculopathy.  Fortunately 
today Dr. Smith was in the clinic and he graciously agreed to see Ms. Smith.  Plain film 
radiographs were performed which reveals hardware failure and L5-S1 disc collapse.  Dr. 
Smith has scheduled her for remedial surgery but this may take some time.  Further 
comment is deferred to Dr. Smith's report.  Ms. Smith did ask me about medication 
options and I defer to her physician but I query whether a neuromodulator such as 
gabapentin may be helpful.  She did say that she did not have any success with Lyrica.  I 
have recommended that she continue with activity to tolerance.

There is therefore no role for spinal surgical intervention at this time and she is in agreement with this.  I think it would be reasonable for her to revisit with her pain clinic for consideration of additional targeted injections, into the right hip joint itself as well as the trochanteric bursa as well as consideration of right SI joint injections as well as gluteal and piriformis.  I have not booked her for routine follow-up at this time.",,"Ms. Smith presents with right leg pain which began in August 2022.  The pain is 
through the anterior leg to the ankle and there is also pain through the right groin.  She 
had physical therapy which was not helpful.  She denies any change to her bowel or bladder 
functioning and there is no perineal numbness.  She is not doing much in the way of any 
exercises currently.  Most of her pain is through the right groin and buttock.  She is taking a 
neuromodulator, the name of which she could not recall.
Review of her medical history reveals diabetes and hypertension.  She had a total left knee 
replacement and revision in 2021.  She has osteoarthritis of the shoulders and hips and has 
had cortisone injections to her shoulders and left hip.  She is allergic to codeine.  She does 
not smoke.  Her surgical history includes mastectomy for breast cancer, hysterectomy, as 
well as the left total knee replacement.  Medications include metformin, insulin and an 
antihypertensive the name of which she could not recall.  Ms. Smith is very limited with 
respect to her abilities to perform activities of daily living.
On physical examination her habitus is endomorphic.  She was in a wheelchair and says that 
she cannot walk for very long.  There was an increase in pain with attempted flexion and 
extension of the lumbar spine.  She could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 1+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally. Power is graded 5/5 except for the 
right quadricep which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical and sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the right with nerve root 
tension.  There is some diminished internal rotation of the right hip with an increase in pain. 
 Upper limb reflexes are 2+ with negative Hoffmann sign.
A lumbar MRI was performed at GMI on October 21, 2022 and this reveals a right-sided L4-
5 foraminal stenosis.
My clinical impression is Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with right L4 nerve 
root irritation and she also may have some right hip internal derangement or arthralgia.  
Plain film radiographs of the hip were performed today but these revealed only mild 
osteoarthritis.  It remains my opinion that there may be internal derangement and possibly 
a labral tear.  She appears to have some right L4 radicular symptoms but there is no 
significant motor deficit other than some mild weakness of the right quadricep.  At this 
point in time she may be a candidate for surgical consultation should she not respond to an 
epidural injection.  I referred her to a pain clinic for consideration of a right L4-5 
transforaminal epidural injection.  I recommend that she be referred into the hip and knee 
hip and knee central intake program for further evaluation.  Should she  respond to the 
injection then surgical consultation will be considered with Dr. Smith.

He needs to be off his warfarin at least 5 to 7 days.  We will contact thrombosis.",,"Review of his medical history reveals that he suffers from factor Smith and dyslipidemia.  
He has had blood clots in both the right and the left legs.  He does not smoke.  He is 
allergic to penicillin and pollen.  Prior surgeries include a left knee arthroscopic procedure 
and hernia.  Medications include warfarin and a statin.  Mr. Smith is limited with his 
ability to perform his activities of daily living.
On physical examination he was greeted in the reception area.  His gait and cadence was 
normal and he was not using any supports.  He stands 5 feet 7 inches weight 185 pounds.  
There was an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  There was Smith sign with 
lumbar spine extension from of flexed position.  He could heel and toe walk without 
difficulty.  Reflexes are 2+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1

L3-4 and moderate to severe canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative 
changes.  At L3-4 on the right there is a disc protrusion with caudal migration and 
impingement of the right L4 nerve root.  There is advanced facet arthropathy at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication along 
with mechanical back pain.  Given the ongoing and worsening of his symptoms I am 
referring him for surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  At the same time for his lower 
back pain I have referred him to a pain clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet joint 
blocks.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed flexion-based exercises and 
activity to tolerance.
