he was referred into me by Mr. Dos Santos from the Regional ISEAC program for lumbar
instability issues.
 
He is a 58-year-old very Portuguese construction worker still working despite problem
back pain that came on about a year ago after a fall at work that took him off the job
for fully 6 weeks, settling down only with administration of physiotherapy and injections
from the pain clinic.
 
He has had problem with activity related back pain ever since and struggles a great deal,
and honestly he would be off work if he had WSIB coverage, but he does not and he feels
very distressed.
 
He has had no incontinence or constitutionality with this and pain does ease off a bit
when he rests over the long weekend or something like that.
 
Pain is largely back dominant, but extends globally through the left leg, also the right
thigh.
 
Physical exam shows a tremendously rotund fellow who heaves himself up out of our
examining room chair only with difficulty and has a very short-strided careful gait,
antalgically favoring the left leg.
 
He is honestly to fix that to appreciate much of a bulk and tone in the lumbar spine, but
at the legs, there is an obvious loss of tone in the left quadriceps compared to the
right.  Bulk is the same to my tape measure at the thigh and the calf.  Manual motor
testing finds I can easily over powered his left-sided quadriceps which I should never be
able to do, the right side is rock solid and the foot and ankle motors are all good too.
 
Check x-rays show a left-sided Bertolotti syndrome at the lumbosacral joint with a lytic
grade ____ spondylolisthesis above at L4-5.  MRI confirmed the expected high grade
central and neural foraminal stenosis L4-L5 to explain the symptoms.
 
This is a surgically correctable problem.  He would need an instrumented decompression
and stabilization L4-L5 for optimal prognosis.
 
With his wife attending, I have done my best to explain the pathoanatomy of what is going
on, showed him the scans and explained what would be involved in a corrected operation
with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent time from issues.
 
Before we can go to the operating room, the gentleman needs sleep apnea testing, given
the size I have asked him the questions and sure enough, he is frequently awakening at
night and feels dry in the mouth, so he is probably mouth breathing to try to compensate.
My office can arrange that.
 
Nothing is going to happen quickly at the operating room.  It routinely takes me a good
6-12 months to bring even a fairly urgent case to the theater but I will take consent
today and put him in the list, so I can look after him as I can.
 
In the interim, of course, if things are getting worse, I have asked him to pick up the
phone and call my office so we can jump the queue if need be.
",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left leg pain.  The onset 
was a few years ago, and increased with a fall about 1 year ago.  He has lower back 
pain daily and finds it difficulty to work. He has standing and walking tolerances of 
only about 5 minutes.  He has not notice any significant improvement with exercises.  
Paraspinal injections did not provide him with any relief.  His medical history is 
unremarkable, but he says that he is pre-diabetic.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L4/5 radiculopathy.  
There is weakness of the left quadriceps and left extensor hallucis longus.  There is 
reduced left patellar reflex.  There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  The 
lumbar MRI was performed January 22, 2021 which reveals a Grade 1 anterolisthesis 
with lysis at L4-5.  There is severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally at this level.  There 
is severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and lower lumbar facet arthrosis, worse at L3-4.
In view of the worsening pain despite the passage of time and conservative 
management, his deteriorated quality of life, as well as my examination and MRI 
findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed exercises.

She is reporting right groin pain.  She has limited walking and standing tolerance.  
She has a history of chronic lower back pain exacerbated with lifting a few months 
ago.  She attends physical therapy weekly which helps a little.  She does yoga and 
bicycles about 10 minutes per day.  Her medical history includes rheumatoid arthritis 
affecting mostly her hands and right knee.  She had a thyroidectomy and takes 
Eltroxin.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  Her 
clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar MRI 
from February 3, 2022 reveals moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 with 
possible impingement of the left L4 nerve root at L3-4.  There is reduced ranges of 
the right hip and recreation on groin pain on provocative testing.
Xrays of her right hip were performed today and these reveal moderate to severe 
osteoarthritis.  I recommend that she be referred into the rapid access hip and knee 
program for further evaluation.  I have also referred her for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha regarding the claudicant symptoms.  She should 
continue with self-directed exercises and can continue with the physical therapy if it 
is helping.

He has noted good improvement in his right leg pain.  He still will occasionally experience what he describes as zaps running down his leg on a random basis.  But the constant and more intense pain is resolved.  He experiences occasional bouts of altered sensation in his foot as well.
 
When I examined him he is slightly hypersensitive in the first webspace and medial foot.  His strength was good on manual muscle testing but he does state he has some difficulties with dorsiflexion towards the end of the day.
 
Given the pain relief that he has experienced I think the ozone procedure has shrunk his disc reasonably well.  I think the ongoing symptoms are likely related to nerve regeneration.  I think he should continue to experience improvement in the symptoms over the next 6 to 9 months.
 
No further follow-up is required.",no imaging,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right foot pain and sometimes into the leg.  
He had a flare up about 1 month ago with lifting, but his symptoms have been 
present for several years.  His sleep is not disturbed due to pain.  He has had 
physical therapy and chiropractic care without significant relief.  He has not had any 
injections.  His general medical history is unremarkable, other than having had 
necrotizing fasciitis as a child requiring multiple surgeries.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is no significant motor deficit, except for weakness of the right EHL.  There is 
no nerve root tension.  An EMG in 2019 revealed findings of L5 radiculopathy.  The 
most recent MRI of his lumbar spine was performed March 29, 2022 which reveals a 
small right L5-S1 paracentral disc herniation.  On personal review of images there is 
marked right foraminal stenosis at the same level with likely impingement of the L5 
nerve root from a combination of degenerative changes, including disc 
protrusion/bulge.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain and foraminal stenosis on MRI, as well as the 
ongoing limitations in functioning, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consideration with Dr. Smith.  We discussed alternatives including intradiscal CT 
guided ozone and I am not certain that he is the best surgical candidate, but given 
the disc protrusion contributing to the stenosis, it is definitely worthwhile having a 
discussion.  He should continue with self-directed exercises.

She has a calcified disc herniation at T7-8.  There is dorsal CSF.  But  the cord is draped over the disc bulge, and there is myelomalacia at that level.  I discussed the case with my colleagues.  In the agree that surgical decompression is warranted given the severity of the myelopathy.
 
She was recently admitted to the hospital for stroke work-up.  However she was not found to have had a stroke, and the findings were due to medication side effects.
 
She has grade 4 power in the lower extremities.  She is severely ataxic.  She is using a walker.
 
I am offering Maureen T7-8 posterior decompression instrumented fusion with transpedicular decompression.  We will try to expedite this as she seems to be worsening and that her motor exam is now worse than previous.
 
Goal of surgery is to halt progression of her myelopathy.  She may not have improvement in her neurologic symptoms.
 
We discussed complications including, but not limited to: dural tear; infection; wound complications; bleeding; injury to: major vessels, major organs; nerve root or spinal cord injury; failure to improve symptoms;weakness; numbness; bowel or bladder dysfunction;  pseudoarthrosis/instrumentation failure; adjacent segment degeneration; revision surgery; malalignment; wrong-level surgery; blood clot; anesthesia-related risks such as pulmonary/cardiac/cerebrovascular complications, including death, paralysis, and blindness.

0.9 to negative 2.4.  She is negative 2.4 on the femoral neck.
 
MRI shows retropulsed fragment causing effacement of the cord at T12.  CT scan confirms
the bony compression fracture.
 
She is neurologically intact.  No long tract signs.  She does have bilateral knee
arthritis.
 
I offered a pedicle subtraction osteotomy at T12 to correct the kyphosis, to stabilize
due to the 3-column osteotomy and osteoporosis ____ T9-L3 posterior decompression
instrumented fusion T12 pedicle subtraction osteotomy.
 
I explained to her that this is a very large procedure with complications can occur.
 
Commonly neurologic issues do occur.  Usually this is radiculopathy which in her case
would manifest as either radicular pain in the chest or pain in the anterior thigh.  Very
rarely people experience some more profound neurologic deficit, in which case we would be
paraplegia and/or bowel or bladder dysfunction.  We will use neuro monitoring for the
procedure.

Procedure will require ventral dissection.  This could result in blood loss, as well as a
pneumothorax which could require a chest tube.

We also discussed other risks, including but not limited to, CSF leak, infection, wrong
level surgery, pseudoarthrosis and adjacent degeneration which are important concerns in
her along with the risks of anesthesia including death, paralysis, blindness, stroke,
heart attack.
 
The patient ____ by his symptoms and wants to proceed.
 
Consent was obtained.  We will go ahead and schedule the procedure.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was insidious in 
September 2021.  She is also experiencing achiness at the anterior legs.  She is also 
describing a burning sensation in her feet, and she has bilateral knee pain.  She is 
able to void her bladder and there is no perineal numbness.  She reports to me that 
she is scheduled to have bilateral knee replacements.  Her health in general is good 
other than hypertension.  She used to clean houses and has been unable to return to 
work since October 2021.
The physical examination reveals her to be neurologically intact, other than reduced 
vibration sense in her feet.  She has significant genu Smith bilaterally.  She is 
status post compression fracture of T12 where there is 80% compression and bony 
retropulsion.  
At this time, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In preparation of the surgical consultation, I have requisitioned 
flexion-extension xray of the lumbar spine.  There is no evidence of instability. I have 
encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with activities to tolerance.  Much of her standing 
and walking limitation appears related to her knee troubles and I anticipate her 
functioning will improve post-knee replacement surgery.

After this informed consent was signed.  Our office will be in contact with her for an operative date.",,"Ms. Howgego presents with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  The onset was 
about 5 years starting with cramping.  The symptoms are increased with walking 
and standing and relieved with sitting and lying down.  She describes paresthesia in 
her feet with lying down.  She has been prescribed exercises, but has not had any 
physical therapy.  For the past few months she has also been experiencing right 
groin pain.  Her medical history is unremarkable, other than a history of IBS.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficiency.  
There is no motor weakness.  There are reduced ranges of the right hip compared 
to the left, which precipitated groin pain.  A lumbar MRI was performed August 22, 
2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5.
Xrays of the right hip and pelvis were requisitioned today.  The radiology report 
notes mild to moderate degenerative changes.  On personal review the degenerative 
changes appear worse on the right.  There also appears to be a degree of 
protrusion acetabuli on the right.  Xray of the lumbar spine in standing was 
performed today for surgical planning.  The study reveals a right convex scoliosis
It is my impression that she is experiencing neurogenic claudication as well as right 
hip arthralgia.  In light of the ongoing leg pain and limited standing and walking 
tolerance (less than 5 minutes), as well as imaging findings, I am referring Ms. 
Howgego for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  At the same time, some 
of her functional problems are in part related to her hip.  I recommend that she be 
referred into the rapid access hip and knee program for further evaluation.  She 
should continue with home-based, self-directed exercises.

One could consider decompression and fusion here if her pain became not manageable with conservative treatment.  However at the present time despite some difficulties Mrs Tiers would like to carry on with conservative treatment.  We did discuss that if her symptoms worsened and she would like to be reassessed by myself that would be perfectly fine and I would just asked Dr. Dul to please send me another referral.,,"Ms. Smith says that her symptoms remain essentially the same.  There is still pain in 
the lower back and posterior thighs, but not radiating past the knees.  The lumbar 
MRI was performed May 17, 2022 and reveals a transitional lumbo-sacral segment.  
There is significant lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and marked facet arthropathy.  
There is a synovial cyst on the right compromising the lateral recess.  There is 
moderate to severe foraminal stenosis, worse on the left at L4-5.
In view of the continuing symptoms, functional limitations and MRI results, as well as 
limited response to conservative care, I am referring Ms. Tiers for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  With or without surgery, if back pain persists 
consideration could be given to referring Ms. Tiers for facet joint/medial branch 
blocks at the L4-5 level.  She can continue with the conservative therapies she has 
been undertaking if she finds benefit.  She should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises.

The 
back pain has been present for about 18 months and she characterizes the pain as a 
pressure or stabbing sensation; increased with prolonged sitting, standing and with 
bending.  Lying down provides relief.  Physical therapy, acupuncture and osteopathy 
have not provided her with any significant relief.  She has also had intramuscular 
injections without relief.  She has tried decompression (traction) without relief.  Her 
medical history is unremarkable, other than a history of kidney stones for which she 
has had lithotripsy.
Ms. Smith was employed as an Educational Assistant, but has not been able to 
return to work since November 2021.  She has been using a cane for a couple of 
months to help with her walking tolerance.
The physical examination today suggests that her back pain is mechanical and 
discogenic.  Her leg pain may be related to nerve root irritation.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed August 18, 2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of midline disc protrusion 
at L5-S1 and mild foraminal stenosis.  Ms. Smith says that her symptoms have 
worsened since this MRI and that a requisition for an updated MRI has been placed.
Given the back dominance of her pain, I am not convinced that she is the best 
surgical candidate. However, given the presence of leg pain and MRI findings, I have 
referred her for spine surgical consultation, as she also wished to pursue any 
surgical option.  I have referred her to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon.  I have also 
referred her to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet 
joint blocks.  Notwithstanding the disc protrusion at L5-S1 she could trial up to 10 
sessions of chiropractic spinal mobilization/manipulation.  I have encouraged her to 
continue with self-directed exercises.

Mr. Smith has tried physical therapy and intramuscular injections in the past 
without relief.  He has not had treatment in the past few years. He does not wish to 
pursue further conservative care as he does not think it will help.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is no identified nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 8, 
2021.   The cardinal finding is a small focal right paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1 
and mild right foraminal stenosis.  There appears to be right L5 nerve compression.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith has right L5/S1 radicular symptoms.  His 
back pain is mechanical.  He was insistent that surgical intervention is the best route 
for him at this point.  While I do agree that surgery may help with his right leg pain, 
his health history would indicate that he may not be the best surgical candidate.  
Surgery may not help with his lower back pain.  I am referring him to Dr. D. Guha for 
his opinion.  For his back pain he could trial side posture spinal manipulation, and if 
this doesn't help, then facet joint/medial branch blocks.  He was reluctant/did not 
wish to pursue further conservative care, in part because he doesn't think it will help, 
and in part that he cannot afford chiro or physio.  I have encouraged him to continue 
with self-directed exercises.

Unsure how to proceed,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of midline lower back pain.  The 
onset was several years ago but pain is worsening.  There is an increase in pain 
with walking and standing, and relief with lying down.  She sought out chiropractic 
care in 2016 without relief.  She does not find that exercises are helping much.  She 
has some bowel urgency, but there is no urinary retention and no perineal numbness 
of saddle anesthesia.  She has limited walking and standing tolerance of about 5 
minutes due to the back pain.  Ms. Smith has occasional numbness in her great 
toes.  Pain can disrupt her sleep and the only medication she is taking is Tylenol 3 
qhs.
Ms. Smith's health history includes having had a right total hip replacement in 
2017, and she is scheduled for a left Smith.  A recent right hip diagnostic ultrasound 
reveals partial thickness tear of the gluteus minimus.  She has just started a new job 
which is sedentary in nature.  She used to work as a driver and teach art, neither of 
which she can do.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
She has mechanical back pain related to a Grade I/II spondylolisthesis at L5-S1.  
There is severe degenerative disc changes and right foraminal stenosis, and 
moderate on the left.  The paresthesia she is experiencing in her great toes is 
related to L5 nerve root irritation.
Given the worsening and disabling lower back pain, MRI findings and notwithstanding 
that she is also scheduled to have her left hip replaced, I am referring Ms. 
Beardwood for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged 
her to remain active to tolerance and continue with self-directed exercises.  Further 
comment is deferred to Dr. Smith.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and right leg pain.  The 
onset was in August 2021 without precipitating event recalled.  There is an increase 
in pain with walking and standing, and relief with lying down.  He had physical 
therapy without relief.
The physical examination findings are suggestive of right L3-4 radiculopathy.  There 
are no long tract signs.  A lumbar MRI reveals a disc protrusion at T11-12 with 
displacement of spinal cord and moderate to severe canal stenosis.  There is a small 
foci of hyper intense signal change on T2 weighted images at T12.  There is 
moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L3-4 on the right.

He is agreeable and so I amended consent today and would hope to jump the queue and get him done somewhere the summer",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and buttock pain.  There is 
numbness at the posterior thighs and legs.  The right thigh pain is worse than the 
left.  He has perineal numbness and reports that he has to exert himself when 
voiding his bladder.  He does indicate he can void.  He says that his feet are 
completely numb.  He did attend for physical therapy for about a month and found 
the treatment/exercises helpful.  Unfortunately, he was cut off from social services 
and cost considerations have prevented him from returning.  The onset of symptoms 
began as back pain, as a result of a motor vehicle accident about 7 years ago and 
his condition has worsened.  His health in general is good.
The physical examination and clinical presentation is consistent with neurogenic 
claudication.  I am concerned about an evolving incomplete cauda equine syndrome 
due to the report of perineal numbness and having to having to exert himself to void 
his bladder.  A lumbar MRI was performed November 15, 2021 and reveals severe 
canal and foraminal stenosis at L4-5 and moderate at L5-S1.
I am referring Mr.  Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I would 
like Mr. Smith to be seen sooner rather than later, and have arranged for him to be 
seen next week.  In the interim, he should be continuing with activities to tolerance.  
Should he experience any bladder retention or if his perineal numbness increases, 
then he has been instructed to attend at the ER at HGH.

teste.  He sometimes experiences sharp pain in the left buttock.  The onset was 
insidious in October 2021, but he has a prior history of lower back pain.  He says that 
when he urinates he cannot tell if he's finished due to numbness.  He has a prior 
history of left leg pain, but nothing presently. There is an increase in pain with 
sitting, but walking is unremarkable.  He is able to get restful sleep and complete all 
of his activities of daily living.  He attended physical therapy without relief, and 
traction made his pain worse.
His medical history is remarkable for diabetes diagnosed in 2003, dyslipidemia, 
essential hypertension, and a myocardial infarction requiring stenting in 2017.
The history suggests possible incomplete cauda equine syndrome.  There is no 
significant neurological deficit and no lower extremity nerve root tension.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed March 26, 2022 reveals a left L5-S1 disc protrusion with 
displacement of left S1 nerve root.  There is a very large Tarlov cyst in the sacrum.  
Mr. Smith reports having had a pelvic ultrasound which was reportedly 
unremarkable.
At this time, notwithstanding improvement to date, but given the history of left 
buttock and leg pain episodes, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation.  I would not expect the disc protrusion to cause compression of the 
nerve roots that can lead to cauda equine syndrome, but query whether the very 
large Smith cyst may be compromising the sacral nerve roots.  I am referring Mr. 
Smith to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon, for his opinion.  I also recommend that Mr. 
Smith be referred to a Urologist to rule out a urological disorder.  Mr. Smith 
should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

There is no known effective treatment for this, these muscle cells have died often been resorbed and we cannot miraculously reconstitute.  Exercise will do it, as she wants to fly to Mexico I am sure she can find a stem cell clinic that will charge her a few $100,000 to inject some stuff in there, that has been done in research and accomplishes nothing.
 
I spent quite some time with the lady explaining this to her and showing her not just her own scans but those of another patient with normal muscle anatomy so she can see the difference with her own eyes and understand the problem.  The risk here if anything is that she is directed to go doctor shopping and find somebody who thinks he can help her by operating on 1 of these worn-out disks, the surgical incision in the muscle will only damage it further and make her symptoms worse.
 
Sadly she is going to have to live with her pain.
 
She is asked me about her gabapentin which is not helping her at all, I certainly think she could stop at any other time because its sedative and she does not need that.
 
The 1 possibly helpful suggestion I would make is that she should try using some walking sticks to help get around, these tend to support a person in a much more neutrally aligned posture than a walker does not and that may ease her myofascial pains somewhat.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock, leg and foot pain.  The pain 
worsens as the day progresses.  The onset was about 3 years ago and there has not 
been any significant improvement.  Physical therapy was not helpful.  He's had a 
couple of epidural injections which provided relief for 5 to 6 weeks. He has limited 
walking and standing tolerance due to his leg pain.  His general medical history is 
remarkable for diabetes and hypertension.  Mr. Smith is not doing much in the way 
of exercises, but has started bicycling.  He cannot sleep on his left side, but this may 
be more related to degenerative changes in his left hip.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There is nerve root tension on the left.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 8, 
2021 reveals lateral recess stenosis bilaterally at L4-5 and L5-S1.
Mr. Smith has left L5/S1 radicular symptoms.  Given the ongoing leg pain, the 
functional limitations, examination findings and MRI results, I am referring Mr. 
Rhodes for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged him to 
continue with self-directed exercises.  I recommend that he be referred into the

Pain produced with Extension
N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left leg pain.  She also has lower 
back pain.  The left leg pain has been present for a few years and is worsening.  
She characterizes the pain as a burning sensation.  She has not had physical 
therapy, but is swimming and lifting weights which helps.  Her medical/surgical 
history includes right total hip replacement, myocardial infarction and stents, and 
hypertension.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with unilateral neurogenic claudication.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed February 5, 2022 reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at 
L4-5 and mild foraminal stenosis.
In view of the leg dominant pain, functional limitations, worsening of symptoms and 
MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. 
Guha.  She should continue with her aquatherapy and other exercises.  There is no 
need for follow-up with myself.

He states that the problem is getting worse with his symptoms in his legs and back and he was very much in favor of proceeding with surgery I discussed with him options including continued conservative measures such as pain clinic but he wanted to proceed with surgery.  The surgery that I would recommend is an L5-S1 decompression with instrumentation fusion with the unlikely possibility of having to go to L4 fusion.  I told his risk of surgery of course with the risk of nonimprovement of symptoms worsening pain weakness numbness in his leg or legs or back adjacent segment disease at the level above with wound healing problems or infection which is higher with a diabetic.  The the risk of CSF leak anesthetic risk and even death.  The patient is in favor proceeding with surgery.  I have ordered dynamic films on him today and we will do the surgery in the new year and he is asking if he could possibly done in February after he gets back from his cruise which I think we can accommodate.,,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation on April 29, 2022.  He reported lower 
back and left more than right leg pain.  The left lower extremity pain travelled to the 
calf, but was most troublesome at the lateral thigh. Lower back pain was 
intermittent.  The onset of symptoms was about 5 years ago.  Mr. Smith was 
attending for massage therapy every three weeks which he found helpful.  He had 
tried physical therapy and chiropractic care in the past without relief.  His medical 
history includes diabetes and hypertension.  The clinical presentation and 
examination was suggestive of left L5 nerve root irritation.  There is no neurological 
deficit identified on physical examination. There are no long tract signs.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed December 10, 2018 reveals a Grade I spondylolisthesis at L5-S1, 
pars defect of L5 and significant left foraminal stenosis.  He was scheduled for an 
updated MRI on August 21, 2022 and I recommended that I follow-up with him after 
that.
The MRI was performed August 21, 2022 and reveals substantially similar findings to 
the study of 2018.  There is a Grade anterolisthesis of L5 on S1 and severe left 
foraminal stenosis.  There is some foraminal stenosis on the right.
Mr. Smith reports on follow-up today that his symptoms remain essentially the same.  
He continues to have left leg dominant pain and limited walking tolerance of about 
half a km.  It remains my opinion that he has left L5 nerve root involvement.  Given 
the unremitting nature of his leg dominant pain and imaging findings, I am referring 
him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  In the interim, 
he should continue with self-directed exercises.

Summarizing Paragraph:
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock and leg pain.  
Symptoms are chronic but increased as of October 2021.  Pain is not improving.  She 
has very limited walking tolerance.  She has consulted with a physiatrist who 
performed intraarticular injection in the right hip, but this provided only very 
transient relief.  Her general health is good.
The physical examination reveals findings suggestive of right L4 nerve root irritation.  
However, her clinical presentation and pain levels appeared disproportionate to what 
is seen on the lumbar MRI where there is right L3-4 disc herniation and foraminal 
protrusion.  There is marked reduction in right hip ranges of motion with pain.  Plain 
film radiographs of the right hip were performed today and these reveal moderate to 
severe right hip join degeneration.
My clinical impression is that most of Ms. Smith's functional limitations are related 
to the right hip pathology.  Pain more distal to the knee may be stemming from L4 
nerve root irritation, and given the MRI findings, I have referred her for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I recommend that Ms. Smith be referred 
into the MSK Central Intake program for hips and knees for further evaluation and 
hip surgical consultation.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

chronic and exacerbated with any sustained positions or activities.   He describes left 
leg weakness and characterizes the leg symptoms as numbness with sharp pain.  
The leg pain can travel into the left foot.  He still attends physical therapy 
intermittently and has had chiropractic care in the past.  Treatments have not 
provided any significant relief.  Mr. Smith's health history includes having had a 
left L5-S1 discectomy in 2001.  His health history is otherwise unremarkable.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant motor deficit.  There 
is reduced sensation to sharp testing along the left L5 and S1 dermatomes.  There is 
a positive straight leg raise on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed September 28, 2021.  There is a cardinal finding of 
left L5-S1 disc herniation with moderate right and severe left foraminal stenosis.  
There is left more than right facet joint degenerative changes.  There is a broad 
based disc herniation at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing left leg radicular 
symptoms, likely from the lateral recess and foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 on the left.  
Given the ongoing pain and functional limitations, and lack of response to 
conservative care, I am referring him for a spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. 
Guha.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed exercises and he could 
follow-up with the advanced practice professional in the community for exercise 
review.  If back pain persists consideration could be given to referring Mr. Smith

Pain produced with both flexion and extension
N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock and posterior thigh pain.  The 
onset was a few years ago and pain is worsening.  Physical therapy, chiropractic 
care, and osteopathy have not provided her with any significant relief.  She has had 
6 epidural injections and only 1 provided some relief transiently.  She applies heat at 
home, but is unable to get restful sleep.  She takes Advil, or Tylenol or Aleve prn.  
Her health in general is otherwise good.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes 
per day.
The physical examination findings are suggestive of right L5 radicular symptoms.  
There is no significant motor deficit.  A lumbar MRI was performed March 4, 2022 
and reveals a caudally directed disc extrusion at L4-5 with mild mass affect on the 
right L5 nerve root.
Given the ongoing and worsening leg dominant pain, the examination and MRI 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  
She should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

His low back pain could be contributed from his degeneration at this level as well.  Not convinced the anterior left thigh pain is coming from the spinal stenosis but could be meralgia paresthetica.  However overall the patient is very severely affected by his right leg pain and low back pain.  As a result I did offer him the options of surgery versus not surgery.  With respect to surgery 1 could do a decompression at L4-5 either unilateral or bilateral and the possibility of adding a L4-5 instrumentation and fusion here could be done.  I did discuss the risk and benefits of both options and then in the end the patient and daughter agreed to do the decompression with instrumentation and fusion at L4-5.  I did also discussed with him conservative measures for example repeat physical therapy and pain clinic.  However they are very much in favor of more definitive treatments for with the surgery.  I explained to him the risk of the surgery include failure to improve symptoms worsening back pain with worsening pain weakness numbness in his leg or legs along with bowel bladder dysfunction.  There is risk of infection which is higher I believe because he is on prednisone and the other RA medication-as a result I asked the patient to contact his rheumatologist and give advice as to possibly stopping 1 or both of these medications.  From my search on rinivog this needs to be stopped 1 week before his surgery and I did inform the patient and the daughter of this.  There is risk of CSF leak as well as adjacent segment disease with the fusion and also failure of fusion and instrumentation.  The patient daughter are aware the risk and benefits and options and they have agreed to proceed with the operation.  I will wait to hear back from the patient regarding his 2 RA medications and stopping him.  We can probably do the surgery in the next few months.

Pain produced with Extension
N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain.  The onset was over a year 
ago as a result of a fall and pain is worsening.  The pain travels to the foot and toes.  
There is an increase in pain with walking and standing, and relief with lying down.  
There is left anterior thigh numbness.  Mr. Smith has undergone physical therapy 
without relief.  He cannot complete his ADLs.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed July 15, 2021 and reveals moderate to severe canal stenosis at 
L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is a Grade I 
spondylolisthesis.  There is a left L5-S1 disc protrusion.  There is moderate 
foraminal stenosis at L4-5 on the right.
In view of the ongoing leg dominant pain, impact on his quality of life, and MRI 
findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  
I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with self-directed exercises.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain which began about 2 years ago.  
He relates that he has experienced improvement with physical therapy, but continues 
to have limited sitting, walking and standing tolerance.  He feels that his recovery 
has plateaued.  His health in general is good.
The physical examination findings reveal signs and symptoms of right S1 
radiculopathy.  A lumbar MRI was performed November 6, 2021 and reveals a large 
right L5-S1 paracentral disc herniation.
In view of the chronicity of symptoms and ongoing functional limitations, as well as 
examination and MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for a spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith. He is attending physical therapy weekly and should continue, and 
should continue with self-directed exercises.

in the form of an open left L2-3 microdiscectomy.  She would very much like to pursue
surgery as soon as possible.  The rationale for and the reasonably perceivable risks of

anesthesia including death, stroke, paralysis and blindness, risks of bleeding and
infection and risks specific to this surgery, including nerve root or cauda equina injury
with temporary or permanent weakness, numbness or loss of bowel and bladder control,
durotomy with CSF leak, potentially requiring revision surgery, failure of symptomatic
improvement, wrong level surgery, degeneration of adjacent segments and reherniation.
She understood and provided informed consent to proceed.  Our office will arrange for a

the earliest opportunity.",no imaging,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left thigh and anterior leg pain.  She 
has also been experiencing left groin pain.  She relates that she cannot sleep on her 
left side.  Symptoms have been present for about 6 months and pain is worsening.  
Chiropractic care was helpful, but she can no longer afford to attend for treatment.  
Other than being a borderline diabetic, Ms. Smith health history is otherwise 
unremarkable.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L3 radiculopathy.  
There is a sluggish left patellar reflex and mild weakness of the left quadriceps.  
There is nerve root tension.  There is also reduced ranges of motion of the left hip, 
but x-rays performed today do not reveal any advanced degenerative changes.  A 
lumbar spine MRI was performed April 25, 2022 and the study reveals left L2-3 disc 
herniation with caudal migration and abutment of the left L3 nerve root.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing a left L3 radiculopathy 
from the identified disc herniation at L2-3.  Given the chronicity of symptoms and 
worsening of pain, as well as ongoing functional limitations including limited standing 
and walking tolerance, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation

we discussed the range of options for his quality of life problems which include
continuing to live with the symptoms, multimodal medication management, physical therapy

Certainly, these would be appropriate only if he again becomes symptomatic.  We did
discuss surgery in the form of left-sided minimally invasive approach for an over-the-top
decompression and resection of the right-sided synovial cyst at L4-L5.  We also discussed
options for injection for a right L4-L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection with
attempted cyst aspiration.  David is keen to pursue that route first and therefore, I
have referred him to a pain clinic for consideration of right L4-L5 transforaminal

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a 1 year history of right leg pain.  Pain levels are variable.  
He has had physical therapy and acupuncture, and found a little relief with the 
acupuncture.  He is performing self-directed exercises.  His health history is 
unremarkable other than a history of asthma.  Mr. Smith is retired.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed November 12, 2021 and reveals a right L4-5 synovial 
cyst with compression of the right L5 nerve root.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing right L5 radicular symptoms.  
This is related to the right L4-5 synovial cyst.  Given the intermittent and persisting 
right leg pain, and imaging findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have recommended to him that he continue with 
self-directed exercises.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of bilateral buttock and leg pain.  The onset 
was a few years ago and his condition appears to be worsening.  He describes the 
leg pain as sharp and achy, increased with activity, and relieved with rest.  
Symptoms do not awaken.  His medical history is remarkable for rheumatoid 
arthritis.  He also reports osteoarthritis of his hips.  He is limited in his ability to 
perform chores at home.  He has limited walking and standing tolerance of less than 
five minutes.
The clinical presentation and history is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  
There is no significant neurological deficit on physical examination.  There are no 
long tract/pyramidal signs.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 19, 2021 and 
reveals a cardinal finding of severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 with small bilateral 
synovial cysts.  There is foraminal stenosis on the left.  Mr. Smith was shown the 
images for his education on his condition. 
In view of the leg dominant pain, the functional limitations and MRI findings, I am

sharp sensation with reduced walking tolerance.  He also says that he has burning 
sensation in his feet at nighttime.  He relates his back troubles to a work related

had a series of epidurals which helped at first for a short time, but eventually 
stopped working.  He says that he had blood work done a few weeks ago and that 
testing, including fasting glucose, was normal.  The clinical presentation was 
suggested of neurogenic claudication, but the history is somewhat atypical.  While 
there are increased symptoms with walking and standing, Mr. Smith also reported 
leg symptoms with lying down and at nighttime.  The physical examination did not 
reveal any significant neurological deficit, which would not be unusual with 
neurogenic claudication.  However, given his comorbidities, I was not convinced he is 
the best spine surgical candidate.  This is notwithstanding that there is moderate 
spinal canal stenosis at L3-4 from an MRI August 27, 2021.  I wanted to rule out 
possible vasculogenic component to his symptoms and requisitioned Doppler 
investigation of his lower extremities.

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections and surgery. We mutually agreed to pursue an injection first, in the form of a right L4-5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection for nerve root block.  I will send a referral to a pain clinic for this purpose.  Should he not obtain durable or adequate relief from this, he knows to call my office and we can discuss the possibility of a minimally invasive right L4-5 hemilaminotomy and microdiscectomy. . .",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right hip, buttock and thigh pain, and 
sometimes sharp and burning sensation into the lateral leg.  He has had recurrent 
episodes, the latest one about 3 months ago.  He has not experienced any significant 
improvement.  He has been attending for physical therapy which provides temporary 
relief.  He is able to obtain restorative sleep.  Mr. Smith says that he has not 
experienced any significant left leg pain since 2020.  His general medical and health 
history is unremarkable.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant motor deficit.  There are 
nerve root tension signs.  A lumbar MRI was performed in March 2020 which reveals 
a moderate to large L4-5 disc protrusion and severe canal stenosis.  Another MRI 
was performed October 8, 2021 and reveals L4-5 disc protrusion and right more 
than left lateral recess stenosis.
It is my impression that Mr. Smith is experiencing right L5 nerve root irritation 
from the disc protrusion at L4-5.  At this time, given the ongoing and recurrent 
episodes of radicular pain and the impact on his quality of life, as well as MRI 
findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  
Consideration should be given to referring him for an epidural injection and referral 
for this is deferred to his physician.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises.

I really do not think just by doing a decompression of the foramen at L5-S1 this would be a significant relief to her chronic low back pain and bilateral leg pain.  I really think that it would be beneficial for her to try further conservative treatments and I encouraged her to please contact the pain clinic which she has been dealing with to see her to book a another appointment in person to try to get her pain under control.  I do not think that any 1 surgery at this point will solve her problem or getting a control but rather I think she needs to break the cycle of pain beginning with a good pain clinic assessment and treatment.  I also encouraged her to try aqua fit therapy which I find sometimes helpful with chronic pain.  She does have a back brace already.  I told her that I be happy to see her again in follow-up in approximately 6 months to gauge her progress.  I certainly wish her all the best.,,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of bilateral left pain, much more prominent on 
the left than right.  The leg pain began about 8 months ago with a slip and fall, and 
pain is worsening.  The pain in the left leg travels as acral as the great toe, while in 
the right lower limb pain is only to the proximal leg.  She has had some physical 
therapy which she found helpful.  Epidural injection was not helpful.  There tends to 
be an increase in leg pain with prolonged sitting and walking.  Her medical history is 
remarkable for IDDM.  She smokes about a half pack of cigarettes per day.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
Smith is preserved in all myotomes.  A lumbar MRI was performed October 28, 
2021 and reveals severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally at L5-S1 and degenerative 
disc disease in the lower lumbar spine.  
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing bilateral L5 nerve root 
irritation from the severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  Given the chronicity of 
symptoms and worsening of pain, as well as her reduced functioning and impact on 
her quality of life, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

She mitigates the pain of that when she is doing her water exercises because the buoyancy of the water offloads her spine.  She is further mitigated that with her planking exercises building core strength to her lumbar extensors as they would be working even involuntarily to spasm and hold her deformity corrected.
 
I can certainly reassure her that I see no neurological or structural disaster in her foreseeable future and there is no hard indication for any prophylactic surgical care at this time.  I think she should work consistently at extending her planking tolerance that will likely increase her comfort significantly.  I have encouraged her to feel safe about the modest analgesia she is using I regularly have people using Tylenol at the maximum 3 g daily dose which is quite safe and that would be her best thing to trial if it works well she might be able to take her self off the Lyrica which from what I see in the scans does not have a hard indication anyway.  It is a medication prescribed for neuropathic pain and that is not her.
 
After extensive discussions with her and her husband attending including review of the x-rays and the scan I think I have been able to reassure her and we have not made any plans to see each other further",,"I initially saw Ms. Smith for consultation on May 12, 2022.  She reported back 
pain and this was related to degenerative changes, with a degenerative scoliosis.  
The physical examination did not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
are no signs of radiculopathy , myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy.  MRI of the 
lumbar spine March 8, 2022 reveals advanced facet osteoarthritis and left convex 
scoliosis.  I recommended that she continue with Aquatherapy and chiropractic care.  
I also recommended blood work up.
Ms. Smith reports on follow-up that she has ongoing lower back pain.  She has 
had physical therapy, chiropractic care and exercises.  She is doing Aquatherapy 
which she has found helpful.  She has also attended at a pain clinic.  Medications 
include: Lyrica 125 mg qam, 150 mg qhs; Tylenol arthritis 1 qhs or prn; and Baclofen 
qhs.
My clinical impression remains the same.  Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back 
pain related to the degenerative scoliosis.  The conservative measures have not 
provided her the kind of relief she wishes, and she has requested a surgical 
consultation.  I think that this is reasonable and I have referred her to Dr. Smith, 
orthopaedic spine surgeon.  She can continue with the more conservative measures 
she has undergone if it provides relief.

office will be in touch with her with regards to booking the appointment.",,"Ms. Quick presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain to the lateral foot.  
The onset was about 1 year ago and pain is worsening.  She has not been able to 
return to work since November.  She is able to void her bladder and there is no 
perineal numbness.  Pain awakens her and she does not get restorative sleep.  Her 
medical history is remarkable for Smith.  She is on anticoagulant medication.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
There is corresponding on lumbar MRI from October 2021 which reveals a left L4-5 
synovial cyst compromising the left lateral recess.
Given the lack of response to conservative management, the leg dominance of the 
pain, functional limitations, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Ms. Quick for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Fortunately, Dr. Smith 
was in the clinic today and agreed to see Ms. Quick today.  Further comment is 
deferred to his report.  Ms. Quick should be continuing with self-directed exercises 
and activity to tolerance.

We spent quite some time together here at the clinic today as I explained the problem shoulder the scans and offered the potential surgical solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues, although also the alternative of ongoing observational management way do not expect things are ever going to change much for her and will only tend to slowly deteriorate.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain and left leg pain.  The 
onset was several years ago and he has not experienced any significant 
improvement.  He is not doing much in the way of exercises.  His medical history is 
only remarkable for hypothyroidism, hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L4 and S1 
radiculopathy.  The back pain is Smith and mechanical.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed May 16, 2022 and reveals cardinal findings of facet arthropathy at L5-S1 
with lateral recess stenosis left more than right, and left L4-5 foraminal stenosis.
Given the ongoing left leg pain and lack of improvement, as well as ongoing 
functional limitations and MRI results, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  For the back pain, I have referred Mr. Smith to 
a pain clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet joint blocks.  I have encouraged 
him to continue with self-directed exercises.

N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and left leg pain.  The onset was 
about 8 years ago and symptoms are worsening.  Her medical history is 
unremarkable.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant motor deficit.  There 
are left leg radicular symptoms and diminished sensation over the left L5 
dermatome, suggestive of left L5 nerve root involvement.  This is likely related to 
severe foraminal and lateral recess stenosis noted on MRI at the left L4-5 level.  On 
physical examination there are decreased range of motion of the hips, but plain film 
radiographs today only reveal mild degenerative changes.
At this time, in view of the persisting left leg pain and MRI findings, and affect that 
pain is having on her functioning, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  Pending this consultation, she may wish to trial a 6 
week program of physical therapy to attempt to improve the lower back pain.  Ms. 
Smith should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left more than right lower back pain.  The 
onset was in March 2020 and he attributes it to a viral infection which affected other 
body areas.  He says that pain is worsening.  He has found transient relief with 
physical therapy and chiropractic care, and he continues with self-directed exercises.  
He is able to obtain restorative sleep.  Mr. Smith has been attending with Dr. Smith for injections (sounds like epidurals?) which he says provides him relief for a 
few weeks.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There are no nerve root tension signs.  Hip ranges of motion are good with no signs 
of internal derangement.  Mr. Smith has a marked left antalgia and anterior list of his 
torso.  This is related to a degenerative lumbar scoliosis.  On review of the MRI from 
April 2021 there is some lateral listhesis and the most prominent changes are in the 
lower lumbar spine.
Mr. Smith presents in some physical distress and cannot walk without the aid of a 
walker.  His pain levels can be intense and he relates that the back condition is 
affecting his quality of life.  Notwithstanding that his pain is back dominant and the 
examination findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. 
Smith.  He should continue with physical therapies.  Dr. Smith may wish to 
consider medial branch/facet joint blocks.

lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 which may be a primary source of his pain.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, the disabling nature of his pain, the physical 
examination findings and MRI results, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  Mr. Smith should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises.

Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left leg pain.  The onset was about 1 
year ago and pain is worsening.  The pain travels to the lateral leg and foot and is 
characterized as lancinating pain with numbness.  There is no reported weakness.  
Ms. Smith has tried physical therapy and chiropractic care without significant 
relief.  The pain can sometimes awaken her.  Her health is otherwise good.  She 
finds it difficult to complete her work days as a pharmacy technician.
The physical examination findings are consistent with left S1 radiculopathy.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed June 25, 2021 and reveals a cardinal finding of left L5-S1 
disc herniation with impingement of the left S1 nerve root.

her for a selective left L3 nerve root block for diagnostic confirmation.  
There was some concern about taking her of her blood thinners.  She nevertheless

I brought up the scan and showed it to the patient explaining the nature of the problem
and what would be involved in the surgical care solution.  He would need aggressive
subtraction of all loose posterior elements below L2 and correspondingly instrumented
stabilization L2 to pelvis.  That is certainly a major operation which will be done on an
inpatient basis, might need some transfusion and keep him in the place for at least a
week or so.
 
It is a very good operation to do and that he is looking at a very high probability of
significant relief of this neuro claudicant symptoms and improved functional tolerance.
 
It turns out the man's absolutely terrified of instrumented spine surgery, this allegedly
because of the unsatisfactory experience of his mother in the hands of a Toronto surgeon
8 years ago.  I have no details there.
 
This man's spine is already flat backed in the MRI and clinically unstable as we assess
him, I think it would be a travesty to look at trying to get him decompressed without
stabilizing his spine, ideally to reconstitute some element of lumbar lordosis and
improve his sagittal plane imbalance indicators.  I would likely do that in this case
with the simple expedience of transosseous screws to elevate and interfere with his
anterior column because his neural foraminal heights are good.  I do not think he needs
formal diskectomies and interbody implants.
 
We spent a long time discussing pros and cons and the issues around his anxiety, I can
flat out tell him that if I put him onto the surgical list today, he is likely not
looking at having anything done for at least a year, if not 2.  Even that did not sway
him from his obvious anxiety and so eventually we reached a point where we decided not to
make any surgical plans.  I gave him my office contact information, referred him to my
patient education website and asked him to contact the office when and if he might decide
he wants to go ahead to surgery, so we can come back in and talk it through again.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of bilateral leg pain.  The left leg pain is 
chronic, while the right leg pain has been present for about a year.  He has limited 
standing and walking tolerance.  He describes some urinary urgency, but there is no 
retention and there is no perineal numbness.
The history and physical examination is consistent with neurogenic claudication, 
bilateral L5 radiculopathy and right L4 radiculopathy.  The lumbar MRI was 
performed January 4, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5, severe 
right foraminal stenosis at the same level, and severe bilateral foraminal stenosis at 
L5-S1.
At this time, given the leg dominant symptoms, his functional limitations, the physical 
examination and MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises.

I told her that the surgery designed to help her back pain and leg symptoms and that usually the leg symptoms are the more likely to improve.  Course there is no guarantees with the surgery.  I explained to her that there is a reasonable chance that she will notice symptomatic improvement.  The risk include the risk of nonimprovement of any symptoms, worsening pain weakness numbness in her leg or legs or back pain.  I explained to her the risk of nonfusion or failure of instrumentation as well as adjacent segment disease.  There is a risk of anesthetic, CSF leak, infection.

bilateral leg pain, right more than left.  The onset was about 2 years ago and 
symptoms were worsening.  Physical therapy and chiropractic care were not helpful.  
Her health in general is otherwise unremarkable.  She has essential hypertension 
and bradycardia.  She reports a history of whitening of her fingers with exposure to 
cold.  
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  There was 
no significant motor deficit on examination.  A lumbar MRI was performed in May 
2020 which reveals moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at L3-4.  There is also 
a left synovial cyst at the same level.  I felt that she was likely a surgical candidate, 
but that updated lumbar MRI was required first.
Today Ms. Smith says that her leg pain has increased and her walking tolerance is 
only about 20 minutes.  Pain can also awaken her.  The lumbar MRI was performed 
May 4, 2022 and reveals moderate to severe L3-4 canal stenosis, and mild to 
moderate canal stenosis at L4-5.  There is a synovial cyst on the left.

nonoperative management; however, we do believe that the pain he is experiencing,
particularly in his leg could be resolved with operative management.  We explained to the

the risks and benefits associated with the surgery including, but not limited to 20% disc
reoccurrence at the level that we are fixing or reoccurrence at a different disc, fluid
leak, infection and nerve damage.  We also explained that since the patient will be under
anesthesia that there are risks associated with this including but not limited to stroke,
heart attack or blindness.  The patient was understanding and agreeable to the plan.  We
consented the patient in clinic today on May 13.  All the patient's questions were
answered to his satisfaction.  We informed the patient that should he have any questions
in the interim to not hesitate to reach out to our clinic.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The pain 
travels as distal as the lateral ankle, and there is numbness at the plantar aspect of 
his foot.  The onset was about 13 months ago.  While he has experienced some 
improvement from the initial intensity, his recovery has plateaued.  The pregabalin 
that has been prescribed is helping to manage his pain. Physical therapy, chiropractic 
care and epidural injection were not helpful.  His health in general is unremarkable.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There is some mild weakness of the left hamstrings.  There are nerve root tension 
signs on the left.  MRI of the lumbar spine was performed May 15, 2021 and reveals 
a left L5-S1 disc herniation with impingement and displacement of the left S1 nerve 
root and possible impingement of the exiting L5 nerve.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was in 
March 2021 and symptoms are worsening.  He has attended for massage, traction, 
physical therapy and chiropractic care without relief.  He has had a few injections 
(described epidural and facet joint block) without relief.  Pain sometimes disturbs his 
sleep.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is no nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was performed July 9, 2021 in Buffalo and 
this reveals a broad-based disc protrusion at L4-5 and L5-S1 without neural 
compression.  There is moderate to severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 bilaterally.
Given the back dominance of his pain, Mr. Smith may not be the best surgical 
candidate.  However, he has almost exhausted conservative options and the pain 
remains debilitating.  There are degenerative changes in the lower lumbar spine.  
Given this, and after exploring for his expectations, we agreed on a surgical 
consultation.  I am referring Mr. Smith to Dr. Smith for his opinion.  At the 
same time, I am referring Mr. Smith to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for 
consideration of medial branch blocks.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith to 
follow-up with his physician for pain control options.  I query whether something like 
Tramadol may proffer him some relief.  He should continue with self-directed 
exercises.

Nevertheless, she has an MRI which does show central disc protrusions but no neural compromise is seen. The patient has not tried any injections which may significantly help relieve her pain. At this point in time surgery would not be indicated since there is no neural compromise and obvious source to explain her pain.

Importantly, the steroid injections should be x-ray guided, transforaminal epidural injections, and be performed in a staged fashion for the right L5-S1 as well as the right L4-L5 spinal nerve roots. If her pain improves significantly and this lasts for several weeks to months, steroid injections would be recommended as a main course of treatment without subjecting the patient to the risks of surgery.

she is experiencing in her feet.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  There is no 
significant motor deficit, except for mild weakness of the left flexor halluces. A 
lumbar MRI was performed March 24, 2021 reveals a Grade II spondylolisthesis at 
L5-S1 with severe canal stenosis.
Given the worsening leg heaviness and numbness, and burning in her feet, as well 
as imaging findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. Smith.  Ms. Smith should be performing activities to tolerance.

Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of leg pain.  The pain is bilateral and began 
about 2 years ago.  She has a history of lower back pain.  She has limited standing 
(10 minutes) and walking tolerance and her functioning seems to be declining.
The clinical presentation is commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A lumbar 
MRI was performed October 16, 2021 and reveals severe spinal stenosis at L3-4 and 
moderate at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.
In view of the ongoing functional challenges, leg dominance of pain and imaging

Mr. Smith presents with buttock and bilateral leg pain, characterized as numbness 
and weakness.  He has limited walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes, and 
standing of 5 to 10 minutes.  Symptoms are alleviated with sitting, but prolonged 
sitting can exacerbate pain.  There is no urinary retention and no perineal 
numbness.  His medical history is unremarkable except for hypertension.
The physical examination findings do not reveal signs of radiculopathy, myelopathy 
or peripheral neuropathy.  There is no nerve root tension.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed October 31, 2021 and reveals multilevel acquired spinal stenosis at L2-3, 
L3-4 and L4-5.  The worst level is L4-5.

Ms. Rate presents with a complaint of burning pain at the left anterior thigh and 
knee.  The onset was about a year ago and pain is worsening.  Physical therapy, 
chiropractic care, and injections have not provided relief.  She reports having limited 
walking and standing tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  Her medical history includes 
fibromyalgia, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and hypothyroidism.
The physical examination reveals findings commensurate with left L3, 4 
radiculopathy.  There is weakness of the left quadriceps.  There is nerve root 
tension.  There is diminished sensation along the left L3 dermatome.  A lumbar MRI 
was performed September 22, 2020 and reveals a cardinal finding of severe canal 
and lateral foraminal stenosis on the left at L3-4.  There is mild anterolisthesis of L2 
on 3, 3 on 4, and 4 on L5.
In view of the imaging findings and lack of improvement with conservative 
management, as well as examination findings, but notwithstanding her age, I am 
referring Ms. Rate for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have also 
recommended that she follow-up with her physician regarding medication options.  
She indicates having tried Smith in the past, but I am not certain if Gabapentin 
was tried.  Consideration could be given to referring her for an epidural injection as 
this may provide her with some relief.  I have requisitioned an updated MRI.

reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 and L5-S1 from a combination of 
degenerative changes.
In view of the significant functional difficulties at this point and diminished quality of 
life, the leg dominance to the symptoms and the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. 
Fabbro for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should 
continue with self-directed, flexion-based exercises.

tender lumbo-sacral junction
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of lower back pain and secondarily right 
leg pain.  The onset was a few years ago and pain is worsening.  She reports that 
she attended for chiropractic care a couple of years ago which helped a little.  More 
recently she has had medial branch blocks which did not help.  Exercises are not 
helping.  She states that her walking tolerance is only 5 to 10 minutes and pain is 
affecting her quality of life.  She has non-restorative sleep due to pain.  Ms. Smith's 
health history is unremarkable.  She does have a history of osteoporosis.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
There are no motor deficits.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 23, 2021 and 
reveals a Grade I spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 with significant facet degeneration and 
foraminal stenosis bilaterally.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing mechanical (lumbo-sacral) 
lower back pain and likely irritation of the right L5 nerve root that is causing the leg 
pain.  Given her failure to adequately respond to more conservative measures, 
involving chiropractic care and facet joint/medial branch blocks, as well as the 
worsening pain and MRI findings, I think it reasonable that we obtain a surgical 
opinion as to whether she may be a candidate for a lumbo-sacral fusion.  I am 
referring Ms. Smith to Dr. D. Guha for his expert opinion.  In the interim, Ms. Smith 
should continue with self-directed exercises to maintain her current levels of mobility 
and activity.

We mutually agreed to pursue ongoing conservative management considering that she has improved and continues to be in a very livable state without any debilitating pain.  I have not booked her for routine follow-up.  Should there be a significant recurrence of any radicular pain in the future she would likely require an updated MRI from her family physician. . ",,"Ms. Smith presents today with a complaint of left more than right lower back pain, 
and left leg numbness.  The onset of symptoms was a few years ago and pain 
seems to be worsening.  The back pain is characterized as an achiness.  Ms. Smith 
does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal 
numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She has tried physical therapy without relief, and 
she sees her chiropractor periodically for treatment which is helpful.  Ms. Smith 
says that she has not had any injections.  Her health in general is reportedly good.  
She is not gainfully employed and is able to manage chores at home.
The physical examination findings reveals that she walks with a normal gait.  There 
is no antalgia.  There is an increase in back pain with lumbar flexion.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is 5/5 L2 to S1, except 
for mild (4+/5) weakness of the left EHL.  Sensation is also mild reduced on the left 
L5 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is no 
clonus/spasticity or other long tract signs. Hoffman's sign is absent and upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Supine straight leg raising did not create neural tension, but slump 
test was positive on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 13, 2020.  The cardinal finding is left L4-5 
disc protrusion with compromise of the left L5 nerve root and degenerative disc 
disease at L5-S1 which is fairly advanced.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing discogenic lower back pain 
and there are some residual signs of right L5 radiculopathy.  She still has some 
paresthesia in the left leg.  At this point, given the back dominance to her pain, she 
may not be the best surgical candidate, but given her concerns about becoming 
completely disabled and the degenerative changes noted in the lower lumbar spine, I 
feel it is appropriate that we seek spine surgical consultation.  I am referring Ms. 
Smith for consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I also recommend that her physician 
consider referring her to a pain clinic for epidural injection which may proffer her 
some relief.  She does not drive, therefore I defer to her physician to refer her 
somewhere in Burlington.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
self-directed exercises.  She could trial a back support belt for when she is 
performing more physically demanding activities.  Ms. Smith has found some 
benefit from chiropractic care and she can continue with this if she continues to find 
benefit.

Mr. Smith presents with right leg pain.  He is in significant pain, and disability.  
Examination findings were commensurate with a right-sided S1 radiculopathy.  
MRI reveals a very large right-sided disc herniation at L5-S1.
Given the lack of improvement, and examination findings, I am referring Mr. 
Smith for spine surgical consultation.  I am attempting to expedite this and he

Our office will arrange for an appointment with the Anesthesia Pre-Operative Clinic, and subsequently arrange an operative date at the earliest opportunity..",,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right leg pain.  The pain has been 
present for a couple of months and is worsening.  Ms. Smith has a history of 
chronic lower back pain, and experienced an acute flare-up in April prompting a visit 
to ER.  She was in hospital for 6 days and had epidural injections which did not help.  
She did see Dr. Smith at that time, but given that her pain was mostly lower back 
dominant and she had not yet had the epidural, he recommended this and a course 
of physical therapy.  Ms. Smith's health history includes insulin dependent 
diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She has been unable to exercise due to 
pain.  She does feel that she is unable to completely void her bladder, but there is no 
report of perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.
The physical examination reveals diminished right patellar reflex and weakness to 
resisted right foot dorsiflexion (4+/5).  There is a positive straight leg raise on the 
right.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no 
spasticity or clonus.  A lumbar MRI was performed April 5, 2022 and reveals cardinal 
findings of right L4-5 extraforaminal disc extrusion with severe foraminal stenosis, 
and impingement of the right L4 nerve root.  There is a right L3-4 disc osteophyte 
complex with displacement of the right L3 nerve root.  There is a calcified disc at 
L1-2 with moderate to severe canal stenosis.  The most clinically relevant finding in 
my opinion is the foraminal disc extrusion at L4-5.  Ms. Smith has extensive 
degenerative disc and facet joint degeneration and this is contributory to her history 
of chronic lower back pain.
In view of the debilitating and worsening right leg pain, the lack of improvement, 
examination findings and MRI results, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with activities to 
tolerance.

The worst of her deformity and stenosis brackets the L2-4 levels.  The L3 and L4 nerve roots got would compress their run to the thighs and shin so the problem fits the complaint and I think we can helper surgically by going to those levels for neuroforaminal decompressions, instrumented stabilization and realignment of the worst of her deformity.  That some moderate operation that in somebody with normal lungs could be easily and safely accomplished on an overnight stay basis, given her problem asthma I recognize some probability we may not be able to operate on her at all when she is prone we may not be able to ventilator and that is a big problem.

pain is characterized as a burning sensation, more right leg than left.   The pain is 
constant with no particular exacerbating or relieving factors recalled.  The pain has

disrupting her sleep.  She has had epidural injections without relief.  Ms. 
Smith has not had any recent physical therapy.  Her general medical history 
is unremarkable.  She is struggling to complete chores at home and has limited 
walking and standing tolerance of less than 5 minutes.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant motor deficit or 
weakness.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  There are no long tract signs.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  A lumbar MRI was performed 
January 22, 2022 and reveals degenerative changes and right convex scoliosis.  
There is moderate canal and left foraminal stenosis at L3-4 and mild canal recess 
stenosis at L4-5.  There is significant left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 on personal 
review of images.
Ms. Smith clinical presentation is somewhat atypical for neurogenic 
claudication.  She has a degenerative lumbar spine with scoliosis which is 
contributing to the lower back pain.  There is stenosis which is likely causing her 
lower extremity pain.  At this point in time, given the chronicity of symptoms, 
worsening of pain and impact on her quality of life, examination and imaging 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim she should be continuing with activities to tolerance.

positive Smith test.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  In the upper limbs 
reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no spasticity or clonus in the 
upper or lower limbs.  A cervical and thoracic MRI was performed January 12, 2022.  
The most concerning finding is at T6-7.  There is a disc protrusion and advanced 
cord compression, but with no signs of signal change.  There is moderate spinal 
canal stenosis at C5-6.
Ms. Smith is reasonably functional at this time and is still able to work, but is 
reporting balance difficulties.  There are subtle signs of myelopathy and findings on 
MRI of cord compression at T6-7.  Given this, I think it appropriate that we seek a 
spine surgical opinion.  I am referring Ms. Smith for consultation with Dr. Smith (I had the opportunity to review the MRI images with Dr. Smith today).  I 
have also requisitioned a thoracic CT scan as there is concern as to whether the 
T6-7 disc is calcified.  For her lower back pain Ms. Smith could consider some 
spinal mobilization to the lumbar spine with a manually trained physical therapist or 
chiropractor.  Any manual treatment directed at the mid thoracic spine should be 
avoided.  Ms. Smith should continue with activity to tolerance.

I think , looking at the anatomy of his MRI, he would need old-style access laminectomies at L3 and L4 with bracketng facetectomies L2-3, L3-4 and L4-5 for thorough decompression there. All that will require concomitant instrumented stabilization L2 to L5. Proximally, some modest neural foraminal decompression L1-2 would do the job. THis is a moderate operation whcih would require at least a short in-patient hospita stay. With his daughter attending, I have explained the problem and proposed surgical solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent time frame issues. I have been very honest about my personal concerns to his condition. and that this should be done sooner rather than later. He is cautiously interested in the surgical alternative, and gave me consent accordingly. I am going to put in for a referral to Jason Ohayon regarding the penicillin allergy, but I do not expect it to come back before the surgery happens. It will not hurt him to have that validated pro or con down the line, regardless. ",,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation June 16, 2022.  He was reporting leg 
weakness and lack of coordination.  He has a foot drop on the right and has tripped.  
There is not so much pain, but the weakness and lack of control of his legs and feet 
is his main concern.  He cannot walk without the aid of a walker.  He did not report 
any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  He 
was also reporting neck pain.  Mr. Smith has attended for physical therapy without 
relief.  He relates disrupted sleep due to neck pain.  Mr. Smith has very significant 
challenges with performing chores due to his mobility issues.  He has standing 
tolerance of less than 5 minutes, and walking of 5 to 10 minutes (with support).  His 
general medical history is unremarkable other than hypertension and heart arythmia.  
Mr. Smith presented using a walker.  His gait is spastic. The physical examination 
findings reveal patellar reflexes to be 3+.  Achilles were 1+.  There is preserved 
power of knee and hip flexion and extension, but there is profound weakness of foot 
dorsi and plantar flexion to resisted testing.  Vibration sense is absent in his feet.  
Superficial sensation is also significantly reduced.  There is a positive Smith's 
test.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  In the upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no dysdiadokokinesia.
A lumbar MRI was performed December 16, 2021.  There is severe canal and 
foraminal stenosis at L3-4, mild to moderate canal stenosis at L2-3 and L4-5, 
moderate left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1, and moderate to severe left foraminal 
stenosis at L2-3.  Images were reviewed with Mr. Smith.
I diagnosed Mr. Smith with acquired lumbar spinal stenosis which is fairly significant 
and he will require a surgical opinion.  However, I was concerned regarding long 
tract signs and about the potential for spinal cord compression in the thoracic or 
cervical spine, which would be of more concern at this point, rather than his lumbar 
spine.  MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was required.  Mr. Smith was advised to 
continue with activity to tolerance and continue to use supports for walking.
On follow-up today Mr. Smith says that his symptoms remain the same.  He is not 
taking pain relieving medications.  The cervical and thoracic MRI's were performed 
July 1, 2022 and reveal moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at C3-4.  There is 
cord compression.  There is moderate canal stenosis at C4-5.
My clinical impression remains the same.  Mr. Smith requires a spine surgical opinion 
with regard to the lumbar and cervical spine stenosis.  I have referred him to Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  he should continue with activity to tolerance.

pain/numbness.  The onset of symptoms was in May 2021.  There is an increase in 
leg paresthesia with walking and relief with sitting.  He is able to get restorative 
sleep.  He continues with self-directed exercises.  Mr. Smith has not had any recent 
physical therapy.  He is not taking any pain relieving medications.  His medical history 
is remarkable for bilateral hip replacements and prostate cancer.  Mr. Smith is 
retired and is able to manage chores at home.
The physical examination findings reveal the right patellar reflex to be 1+ while other 
reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 5/5, except for the right quadriceps which is 4+/5.  
Sensation is diminished along the right L3 and L4 dermatomes.  There is no nerve 
root tension with supine straight leg raising.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is 
negative Hoffman's sign.  There is no spasticity or clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed January 2, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L4-5.  There is significant right lateral recess stenosis at L3-4.  There is a 
degenerative scoliosis.
Mr. Smith presents with neurogenic claudication and symptoms and signs of right 
L3-4 radiculopathy.  His back pain is mechanical in nature.  Given the ongoing 
symptoms and functional limitations, including limited walking and standing 
tolerance, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed exercises.

They will call us back and make an appointment should they want to book surgery",,"Mr. Smith was seen for consultation initially on June 17, 2022.  He presented with 
a complaint of worsening left leg weakness and foot drop.  He had had painful 
paresthesia in the left leg for years.  He underwent an L2-3 lumbar fusion in 2018.  
Mr. Smith had been attending for physical therapy months and had massage 
therapy at first.  He reported a limited walking tolerance of 5 to 10 minutes, and 
standing of less than 5 minutes.  He was able to get restorative sleep.  The physical 
examination findings revealed profound weakness of resisted left foot dorsiflexion 
and EHL.  There was no nerve root tension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the 
patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation was diminished along the left L4 and L5 
dermatomes.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.

and this reveals moderate to severe canal stenosis at L2-3.  I diagnosed Mr. 
Smith with a left L4/5 radiculopathy and progressive foot drop.  An updated MRI 
had been requisitioned and I recommended to Mr. Smith that I follow-up with him 
after the MRI.
The MRI was performed at GNMI on July 18, 2022.  There is artifact from prior 
surgery at L2-3.  At L4-5 there is severe spinal canal stenosis from a combination of 
degenerative changes.

We have also discussed conservative treatment options including specialized pain therapies as alternatives to surgical intervention. We have recommended that he speak to his neurologist regarding his muscle atrophy.  We would be happy to follow up with Kevin via phone appointment once we have received the EMG results.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right more than left leg pain.  The pain 
in the right leg is at the lateral leg and into the dorsum of the right foot.  The onset 
was in October 2021 and he says that he has experienced a little improvement.  The 
pain tends to be worse at the end of the day and Mr. Smith says that he has limited 
walking tolerance of 5 to 10 minutes.  He has seen a neurologist, Dr. Smith, who felt 
that site of his prior surgery (L5-S1 disc replacement) has resulted in scarring and 
perhaps arachnoiditis, and is causing radicular symptoms.  Mr. Smith has been 
attending for physical therapy for upper back pain.  His medical history includes 
having had an MI and cardiac stents, dyslipidemia, and as noted he has had prior 
L5-S1 disc replacement.  He is retired and able to manage chores at home. 
Medications include Lyrica, Plavix, a statin, cyclobenzaprine, and Tylenol 3 prn.
The physical examination findings reveal patellar and Achilles reflexes to be 2+.  
Power is graded 5/5 except for resisted right EHL and flexor halluces which are 4+/5.  
Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical  Sensation is preserved and symmetrical.  
There is nerve root tension on the right with straight leg raising and slump test.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is no clonus or spasticity.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally and there are no other long 
tract signs.  There is pain with costovertebral joint challenge in the mid thoracic on 
the left over rib angles.
A lumbar MRI was performed January 26, 0222.  There is moderate bilateral 
foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  There is mild to moderate foraminal stenosis at L2-3 and 
L3-4, and mild right foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of right L5/S1 radiculopathy.  He has 
had prior surgery at L5-S1 (disc replacement) and (in view of prior surgery and 
possible scar tissue) while he may not be the best of surgical candidates, given the 
ongoing right leg pain and my examination findings, consultation is appropriate.  I 
am referring him to Dr. Smith for his expert opinion.  Concurrently, Mr. Smith 
may find relief with pulsed radiofrequency ablation of the right L5 dorsal root 
ganglion and I am referring him to the Bloor Pain Clinic for evaluation and 
consideration for intervention.  They may also want to address his upper back pain 
which I feel is related to costo-vertebral joint irritation/costovertebral syndrome.  Mr. 
Smith should continue with self-directed exercises, and physical therapy if he finds 
relief, and may wish to consider a trial of 10 sessions of spinal 
mobilization/manipulation for his upper back pain.

We discussed complications including, but not limited to: dural tear; infection; wound complications; bleeding; injury to: major vessels, major organs; nerve root injury; weakness; numbness; bowel or bladder dysfunction; failure to improve symptoms; adjacent segment degeneration; instability; revision surgery; wrong-level surgery; blood clot; anesthesia-related risks such as pulmonary/cardiac/cerebrovascular complications, including death, paralysis and blindness. She consented and wished to proceed.
 ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a history of left leg pain.  The onset was in October 2020, 
initially starting as buttock pain and then into the left lower limb.  The pain currently 
is mostly in the posterior thigh and lateral foot, and there is numbness in the foot.  
Ms. Smith has been attending for chiropractic care which she does find helpful.  
She has also been receiving epidural injections every 3 months which are helpful.  
Overall, however, she feels as if her recovery has plateaued.  Ms. Smith's medical 
history is unremarkable.  She does not smoke.  She works as an accountant.  She 
reports that she has limited standing, sitting and walking tolerance of 5 to 10 
minutes.  She is unable to do more physically demanding chores at home.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left S1 radiculopathy.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ except for the left Achilles which is 1+.  Power is 
graded 5/5 except for repeat left single leg calf raise which revealed 
weakness/fatigue.  Sensation is reduced along the left S1 dermatome.  There is a 
positive left straight leg raise and slump test.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent.  There is no spasticity or clonus.  
A lumbar MRI was performed April 1, 2022 and reveals a large left L5-S1 disc 
extrusion with significant compromise of the left lateral recess.
Given the persisting left leg dominant pain, the examination findings, MRI results and 
the continuing impact that the leg pain is having on Ms. Smith's quality of life, I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She can 
continue with chiropractic care if she finds benefit.  She should also continue to see 
her interventionalist, Dr. Smith, as she has found benefit from the procedures.  Ms. 
Smith should be continuing with self-directed exercises at home.

symptoms are most troublesome, and worse on the left.  The onset of leg pain was 
in December 2021 and he relates that pain and functional difficulties are worsening.  
He has standing and walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes.  He has attended for 
physical therapy and acupuncture which he has not found helpful, but an epidural in 
April was helpful for a few weeks.  Mr. Smith's health history is otherwise good.  
He says that recent blood work did not reveal any abnormalities.  He has had prior 
lumbar discectomy at L4-5 in the remote past.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant abnormality.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are symmetrical.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  
Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and 
Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 7, 2022 at GNMI.  The cardinal finding is 
severe spinal canal stenosis at L2-3 and L3-4 from a combination of degenerative 
changes.  
Mr. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication and has significant functional 
limitations at this point.  Given this and MRI findings, I am referring him for spine

As he is also having problems with his right knee we suggested he has his surgical intervention for the knee prior to any surgery for his back.  He can continue following up with Dr. Dos Santos in regards to his back and will need a repeat MRI prior to returning to clinic with Dr. Pahuta if needed in the future.  We have advised him to continue to be active with non load bearing activities such as biking and swimming.,,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain and weakness.  He relates that 
most of the pain is about the right knee, but there is also heaviness of the leg and it 
can give way.  He relates that he has been using a cane for about 1 year to improve 
his stability.  Mr. Smith relates that his walking tolerance is only about 20 years.  His 
sleep is not disrupted.  His medical history is remarkable for a myocardial infarction 
and stent.
The physical examination significant mobility issues.  Mr. Smith reports that his 
walking tolerance is only about 20 yards.  He presented today in a wheelchair.  The 
examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  Power is preserved 
at 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished in the right foot in a 
non-dermatomal distribution.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ bilaterally at the 
Patellae and Achilles.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  There 
is no spasticity or clonus, or other signs of myelopathy.  There is hypertrophy of the 
right knee joint and tenderness about the knee and joint lines.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed March 4, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal stenosis at L4-5, L3-4 and 
L2-3 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is significant buckling of 
nerve roots at the conus.
It is my clinical impression that Mr. Smith is experiencing unilateral neurogenic 
claudication.  Much of his ambulation difficulties however may in fact be from the 
arthritic right knee for which he is to undergo a knee replacement.  He says that a 
surgical date has yet to be established.
At this time, given the deterioration of his functioning and MRI findings, and not 
withstanding the concomitant right knee issue, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue

With his wife attending of asked I explained my assessment of the situation today and offered the potential benefit to be had from surgical care here, I would offer him a PLIF reconstruction which in my practice is a routine overnight stay operation with good outcome probability for most people.  Here, the surgery will be a challenge because the man is so big and pain control may be a challenge because he is got a baseline familiarity with Oxycocet so I proposed to admit him in for a few days perioperatively.  We touched on risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues.  On prognostication I have told him that the balance of literature on operating mono segmental for back dominant pain suggests at best a 2 out of 3 probability of significant pain relief, and that the very limited reporting of outcomes for internal lumbar disc derangement is much more favorable. He is agreeable to considering surgery I have explained that this would be entirely elective, he can likely expect it to be a couple of years before elective surgical care would come available to him in this healthcare system.  He seems fine with that and I will put him onto my wait list accordingly",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The pain is chronic for 
about 10 years and worsening. At this time the pain is affecting his quality of life, 
and he relates limited standing tolerance.  Pain is disturbing his sleep and he has an 
increase in pain with lying down.  He has done physical therapy, massage, 
osteopathy and chiropractic care.  He relates that chiropractic care helps a little.  He 
takes OxyContin qhs for pain relief.  He did have a medial branch block which helped 
for about a month.  He is scheduled for follow-up in December 2022.  Other 
medications include dutasteride, rosuvastatin, afluzosin, and edarbi.  Mr. Smith 
reports a secondary complaint of numbness through the left anterior thigh.  His 
medical history includes hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The physical examination findings do not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  
Reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in 
all dermatomes.  There are no nerve root tension signs.  There are no long tract 
signs.  There is tenderness at the lumbosacral level, and there is a positive Smith's 
test (lumbar rotation with extension) on the left.  A lumbar MRI was performed 
September 4, 2021 which reveals degenerative disc disease.  The cardinal finding is 
at L5-S1 where there is advanced L5-S1 degeneration, modic changes of endplates 
and on personal review the disc collapse is more prominent on the left.
Mr. Smith has mechanical back pain related to the degenerative changes at L5-S1.  
Typically, the best surgical outcomes are for leg dominant pain.  In this case, 
however, given the worsening lower back pain and disabling nature of pain, as well 
as imaging and examination findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith to determine if he might be a candidate for a 
lumbo-sacral fusion.  Lumbar plain film radiographs were performed today in 
preparation of that consultation.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that he 
follow-up with the pain clinic.  He should be continuing with self-directed exercises, 
and can continue with chiropractic care if he finds relief.

193,193,471,2022-06-23 00:00:00,Yes,No,No,0,1,225,4,1.0,0.0,0.0,My feeling is the patient has neurogenic claudication arising from spinal stenosis at L2-3 and L4-5.  As result I offered him a decompression laminectomy from L2-3 and L4-5 which essentially will turn out to be an L2-5 decompression laminectomy.  It indicates a fusion operation but I will get dynamic films on the patient today.  I explained to him that I think is a reasonable chance his symptoms in his legs will improve following the surgery but of course there is no guarantee.  There is a risk of worsening back pain worsening pain weakness numbness in his leg or legs or bowel bladder dysfunction.  There is risk of CSF leak and infection as well as anesthetic risks and instability in the spine.  I did discuss conservative with the patient including return to the pain clinic physical therapy but the patient is in favor proceeding with an operation which I think is reasonable.  We will book the case in the next few months.  The patient is traveling to Germany and returns at the end of September.  I look forward to seeing him again.,,"The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith to be neurologically intact.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+, except the right patellar reflex which is 1+.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 5/5 
L2 to S1 bilaterally.  There is no nerve root tension with straight leg raising.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes 
are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  There is no spasticity or clonus.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed March 12, 2022 and reveals severe spinal canal stenosis 
at L2-3.  There is also moderate to severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally.  There is 
severe canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  These 
findings are concordant to his symptoms.  Given his reduced functioning and the 
impact that symptoms are having on his quality of life, I am referring Mr. Smith for a 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

Immediately above there is bone-on-bone discopathy L4-5 with evidence of old right-sided laminal foraminotomy for decompression.  Proximal to that the spine looks good but the lumbar lordosis index is reversed as she has only 15 degrees of lordosis L4 down and 35 degrees above it. She has no lumbopelvic mismatch with a pelvic incidence of 60 degrees and overall lumbar lordosis 50 but pelvic tilt is abnormal at 30. MRI shows no evidence of any stenosis anywhere and no evidence of arachnoiditis or epidural fibrosis at the old surgical site.  Very honestly the discs proximal and distal to the L4-5 level are just about textbook normal which is a pleasant surprise in somebody of middle-age with a history of smoking and obesity. I think she do well with an L4-5 motion segment reconstruction ideally incorporating anterior column reconstruction/realignment to improve her lordosis index and sagittal plane balance parameters. Today I have explained the problem and proposed surgical solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues.  She is cautiously interested in going onto the surgical list and gave me consent accordingly, where I will remind her expectedly easily be a year if not more until we can bring her to the operating room. I will look forward to helping her out when I can ",,"Ms. Smith presents with Smith/mechanical lower back pain.  She is on a wait list 
to attend the DeGroote Pain Clinic.  At this time, given the disabling nature of her 
back pain, I am referring Ms. Smith to Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon, to 
assess for her candidacy for an L4-5 fusion, and whether this may be an option for 
her unremitting back pain.

Happy to follow up with the patient in the future if required. Thank you for involving us in this patient's care. Please feel free to contact us with any questions or concerns.,,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock and right leg pain to the right 
calf.  He characterizes the pain as an ""ache"" and ""pulling"" sensation.  The onset was 
about a year ago with lifting.  Pain levels are variable, and Mr. Smith indicates not 
having experienced any significant improvement.  There is no change to bowel or 
bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  The pain tends to be worse 
first thing in the morning.  Mr. Smith is continuing with self-directed exercises 
which do not provide significant relief.  His general health history is good. He does 
not smoke.  He is allergic to penicillin.  Mr. Smith has not been able to return to his 
work as a Machine Operator since October 1, 2021.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with right S1 radiculopathy.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+.  Power is graded 4+/5 for the right flexor halluces.  
Otherwise power is 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  There is negative straight leg raising on the right, but there is 
crossover into the right buttock and posterior thigh with left straight leg raising.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI was performed September 18, 2021.  The cardinal finding is a right 
L5-S1 paracentral disc herniation.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a right S1 radiculopathy.  His 
symptoms are debilitating and he has not been able to resume gainful employment.  
Given the persisting leg dominant pain, examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  In the interim, Mr. 
Smith should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include  continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections  And surgical intervention  . We mutually agreed to pursue surgery, which was offered in the form of a minimally invasive right-sided approach for L4-5 bilateral canal enlargement with resection of bilateral facet cysts including an over-the-top approach for decompression of the left cyst. The rationale for the procedure and reasonably forseeable risks were explained, which include but are not limited to, those of general anesthesia, including death, stroke, paralysis and blindness, risks of bleeding and infection potentially requiring revision surgery, and risks specific to this procedure, including  cauda equina  or nerve root injury with temporary or permanent weakness, numbness and/or loss of bowel/bladder control, durotomy with CSF leak potentially requiring revision surgery, failure of symptomatic improvement,    , index or adjacent segment degeneration including disc reherniation, wrong level surgery.  Patricia  asked appropriate questions and provided informed consent. Our office will arrange for an appointment with the pre-operative Anesthesia clinic, and subsequently arrange an operative date..  Our office will arrange for an appointment with the Anesthesia Pre-Operative Clinic, and subsequently arrange an operative date at the earliest opportunity. .",,"Ms. Smith presents with a 6 month history of left buttock and leg pain which is 
worsening.  Exercises have not been helping, and she has also had injections which 
have not helped.  The pain disturbs her sleep.  She was unable to perform her job 
duties and was let go.  Ms. Smith does not report any change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She is taking 
Tramadol HCL 100 mg x 3 qhs, Baclofen 1 to 2 tabs per day, and Fluvoxamine 100 
mg x 3 qhs, as well as Pantoprazole.  Her health in general is good.  She is a 
non-smoker and does not have any known allergies.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5/S1 radiculopathy.  
Muscle  stretch reflexes are 2+ bilaterally.  There are a couple of beats of clonus of 
the left foot.  Power is grade 5/5 L2 to S1, except for resisted left EHL, foot 
dorsiflexion and hamstrings which were graded 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along 
the left L5 dermatome.  There is diminished muscle bulk and tone of the left calf 
musculature.  There is a positive supine straight leg raise on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 26, 2022.  The cardinal finding is at L4-5 where 
there are synovial cysts, more prominent on the left with compromise of the lateral 
recess.  These findings explain her symptoms.
At this time, given the worsening and disabling left leg pain, examination and MRI 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  
An appointment has been arranged for July 5, 2022.  In the interim, Ms. Smith 
should continue with activity to tolerance.  She says that she has tried Smith but this 
produced weight gain.  I have recommended that perhaps another neuromodulator 
could be tried, eg Gabapentin, but that she should speak to her physician.

foraminal stenosis.  There is also a far lateral disc protrusion at L4-5 and abutment 
of the left L4 nerve root.  There is a disc extrusion at L2-3 and moderate left lateral 
recess stenosis and posterior displacement of nerve roots.

We discussed with Albert why a nerve root block on the left side at L5 may help both diagnostically as well as with managing his pain.  We can put in this referral for him however he should follow-up with his family doctor in regards to his pain while waiting for this appointment.  We also recommend a physiatrist referral to help manage his pain nonoperatively.,,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left thigh and leg pain, and left foot drop.  
Symptoms have been present for more than a year, and he has begun to experience 
right leg pain.  There is an increase in pain with walking and standing, and relief 
with sitting.  He does not have any significant lower back pain.  He has had physical 
therapy without relief.  He tries to exercise, but his walking tolerance is limited to 5 
to 10 minutes.  Mr. Smith that the unrelenting pain is affecting his mood.  His 
medical history is otherwise good.  He has had total knee replacement bilaterally.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left unilateral neurogenic 
claudication and L5 radiculopathy.  There is weakness of the left EHL at 4+/5, but 
otherwise power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at 
the left patellae and Achilles.  Right patellar reflex is 2+.  Sensation is preserved in 
all dermatomes.  Supine straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 20, 2022.  The remarkable findings are: 
moderate spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  
There is severe foraminal stenosis at L5-S1 and degenerative disc disease.  There is 
a small left L4-5 synovial cyst and moderate foraminal stenosis.
In view of the ongoing and worsening left leg dominant pain, the examination and 
MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Mr. Smith to continue with self-directed exercises.

I have not booked her for a follow-up at this time. Thank you for the kind referral and the privilege of participating in the care of this pleasant patient.,,"Ms. Smith presents with a constellation of symptoms including lower back, groin 
pain, left thigh pain and lower extremity weakness.  She describes urinary frequency 
and incomplete voiding of her bladder.  There is an increase in pain with standing, 
sitting and walking.  The majority of her pain is in the left thigh.  Physical therapy 
was not helpful.  Ms. Smith relates very limited walking tolerance and she is using 
walking sticks.  Her symptoms are worsening.  She relates that she has seen an 
internist and neurologist.  An MRI of the lumbar spine and pelvis has been ordered.  
Her medical history is rather unremarkable.  Her surgical history includes a stent in 
the left subclavian artery.
The physical examination findings reveal the left patellar reflex to be a little sluggish 
compared to the right.  There is a positive slump test on the left, and positive 
femoral nerve stretch test on the left.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There are no long tract/pyramidal signs.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed May 4, 2021 and reveals degenerative disc changes.  There is a slight 
disc protrusion on the left at L2-3.  Ms. Smith had an EMG study, but the results 
are not available today.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing a left L3 radiculopathy.  
This diagnosis would not explain all of her symptoms, including reported weakness 
and very limited walking tolerance.  She is to have an updated MRI and follow up 
with her neurologist.  I have recommended that I could follow-up with her after that.  
At this point there is nothing from the examination or imaging to date that would 
prompt me to refer her for a spine surgical consultation.  The constellation of 
symptoms have yet to be fully diagnosed.

leg pain to the ankle, and also lower back pain.  Symptoms had been present for 
more than a year.  He had undergone physical therapy, traction and acupuncture 
without relief.  He had injections at a pain clinic with only temporary relief.  His 
health history was only remarkable for high uric acid levels.  The only medications he 
was taking were Ibuprofen prn, and Allopurinol.  The pain was having a significant 
impact on his quality of life and cannot ski or walk for distance.  The physical 
examination revealed normal gait and no antalgia.  He could not perform toe walking 
or single leg calf raise on the left due to weakness.  Sensation was diminished along 
the left L4 dermatome.  There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  Hip ranges 
of motion were within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes were 2+ and Hoffman's 
sign was absent bilaterally.  A lumbar MRI was performed January 24, 2022.  There 
is moderate to severe right and moderate left foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  There is 
degenerative disc bulging at L4-5 and L5-S1.  My clinical impression was that Mr. 
Vickers had left L4 and S1 radiculopathy, and there may be neuropathic pain.  I 
referred him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith and recommended 
EMG study.  I recommended that he continue with self-directed exercises.
Mr. Smith reports that he continues to experience left leg pain and weakness.  He 
is beginning to experience some pain on the right.  He is still performing self-directed 
exercises and is able to bike.  He feels that his symptoms are slightly worse than 
when I saw him.  He is not taking any pain relieving medications regularly.  His 
overall health remains the same.
My clinical impression remains the same.  He is awaiting a surgical consultation.  I 
recommend that consideration be given to referring him for neurology consultation 
and also for referral for epidural injection.  Perhaps he can discuss with his current 
interventionalist.  I recommend that an updated lumbar MRI be considered given his 
worsening symptoms.  I would be pleased to follow-up with him afterwards should 
this be requisitioned.

onset was about 7 months ago and pain is worsening.  There is paresthesia in her 
toes.  She is in too much pain to do exercises, and reports when she was able to 
perform them there was no significant relief.  She is taking Gabapentin 300 mg tid, 
and Advil xtra strength 5 to 6 per day for pain relief.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of 
cigarettes per day.  She is struggling to perform chores at home, and cannot walk 
for any extended period.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1, except for resisted left ankle dorsiflexion and left EHL 
4/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved and symmetrical 
in all dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent.
A lumbar MRI was performed May 11, 2022.  There is a left L4-5 disc protrusion and 
compromise of the left L5 nerve root.
Given the worsening left leg dominant pain, the chronicity of symptoms, the impact 
on her quality of life, and the examination and MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith 
for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should 
continue with activity to tolerance.

N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left leg pain.  The onset was in January 
2021 as a result of a fall.  The leg pain intensified after endometriosis surgery in 
October.  She has been receiving intramuscular injections which only help a little.  
She is also seeing a chiropractor weekly and treatment helps with her mobility.  
Overall, her leg pain is not substantively improved.  Her health in general is good 
other than a history of endometriosis and hypertension.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with a left S1 radiculopathy.  
There are nerve root tension signs.  A lumbar MRI performed November 14, 2021 
reveals a left L5-S1 disc extrusion with compression of the left S1 nerve root.
Given the unremitting left leg dominant pain, physical examination findings and MRI 
results, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation.  I am referring her 
to Dr. D. Guha for his expert opinion.  She should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises.  She can continue with chiropractic care if she finds benefit.  Weight loss 
is encouraged.

Mr. Smith was seen today on a request for expedited consultation from Dr. Smith.  Mr. Smith presents with his wife.  He has limited walking and standing 
tolerance (less than 5 minutes) and was in a wheelchair.  He is reporting limited 
walking tolerance, but his chief complaint is weakness and incoordination.  The onset 
of symptoms was about 5 months ago.  He also has lower back pain.  He has 
diabetes and has a history of a remote brain injury.  He smokes about 1.5 packs of 
cigarettes per day. 
The physical examination findings reveal long tract/pyramidal signs.  There are 
upgoing toes bilaterally.  He has dysdiadikokinesia.  There is a positive Hoffman's 
sign on the right.  Patellar and upper limb reflexes are hyperreflexic.  He has weak 
grip strength on the right.  Mr. Smith has balance problems and could not heel/toe 
walk.
The findings are commensurate with cervical spine myelopathy, likely from a 
spondylotic process.  He has some mechanical lower back pain, and I would not rule 
out lumbar stenosis, but the main concern at this time is the cervical spine.  Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon, was in the clinic today and kindly saw Mr. 
Smith.  An expedited cervical spine MRI was requisitioned.  Mr. Smith will be 
following up with Mr. Smith and there is no need for follow-up with my self at this

would be pleased to see him again.

physical therapy.  He had also had injections.  Doppler study of the lower limbs was 
reportedly normal.  His symptoms used to be present only with walking and 
prolonged standing, but now they are more constant.  The clinical presentation was 
consistent with neurogenic claudication.  The physical examination does not reveal 
any significant neurological deficit, other than mildly weak right EHL.  An MRI of the 
lumbar spine was performed in 2018 which reveals canal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5.

worse on the right.  He has limited walking and standing tolerance.

We did discuss the role of continued observation, epidural injections, surgery. At this point he is not ready to consider surgery. He is going to follow-up with family doctor regarding a referral to an interventional pain clinic. He will follow-up with me if he is interested in surgery in the future. If there is anything I can do to further assist you in the care of this patient, please do not hesitate to contact me. ",,"Mr. Smith was initially seen for consultation on February 10, 2022.  He reported 
intermittent left buttock pain, and previously had left leg pain which resolved.  He 
had experienced significant improvement.  Mr. Smith has a prior history of lower 
back pain which has responded to chiropractic care.  He was continuing to perform 
home based exercises regularly.  His health in general is essentially unremarkable.  
The physical examination findings did not reveal any significant motor deficit, other 
than diminished left patellar reflex.  There is no nerve root tension.  MRI of his 
lumbar spine was performed May 28, 2019 reveals moderate to severe canal 
stenosis at L4-5 and left foraminal stenosis at the same level.  My clinical impression 
was that Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of a left L4 radiculopathy.  Given the 
improvement, and notwithstanding the MRI findings, there was no identified need for 
updated advanced imaging or referral for surgical consultation.  
Mr. Smith says that since I saw him in February his condition has declined.  There 
is significantly more pain.  He has attended for physical therapy on three occasions, 
massage and acupuncture without relief.  Most of the pain currently is in the left 
buttock and bilateral leg pain and heaviness.  There is an increase in pain with 
walking and standing, and relief with sitting.  Symptoms are not too bad at night and 
he indicates getting restful sleep.  He is taking Pregabalin 50 mg bid for pain relief.
The physical examination findings reveals power to be 5/5 L2 to S1.  There is 
symmetrical muscle tone and bulk.  Reflexes are 1+ except for the right patellar 
reflex which is 2+.  Muscle tone and bulk is normal and symmetrical.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is no clonus or 
spasticity.
Given the ongoing leg dominant pain and the impact on his functioning, as well as 
MRI findings, I have referred Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also requisitioned an updated lumbar MRI, but a requisition could 
also be outside the General if the wait is shorter.  Mr. Smith should continue with 
self-directed exercises.

does have a left L4-L5 paracentral disc herniation that could be explaining the majority
of her left-sided symptoms and perhaps her mild right lateral recess stenosis at L5-S1
explaining her right-sided symptoms.  Given the incompletely concordant imaging findings,
I had a long discussion with Judith today that it would be reasonable to consider
injections as a next step.  Specifically, I discussed the idea of a first left L4-L5
transforaminal epidural steroid injection and should this provide either incomplete or
inadequate relief particularly of her right-sided symptoms, then a second stage right L5-S1
transforaminal epidural steroid injection to see if this alleviates her right leg
symptomatology would be appropriate.  She is in agreement with this plan and I will make
a referral to Dr. Visnjevac for this purpose.  I have not scheduled for a routine
followup at this time; however, should she obtain inadequate or short-lived relief from
these injections, then I will be happy to see her again at that time for consideration of

right leg pain.  The left pain is characterized as a burning and sharp pain with 
numbness about the left ankle and foot.  Most of her pain is in the left buttock and 
posterior upper thigh. Physical therapy had not helped.
The clinical presentation was commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  There is 
no significant motor weakness.  X-rays of the lumbar spine revealed degenerative 
changes at the upper and lower lumbar spine. I requisitioned a lumbar MRI.
Ms. Smith reports today that her symptoms remain unchanged.  She has limited

N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back, left buttock and leg pain.  The 
leg pain is characterized as sharp in sensation, and there is paresthesia in his toes.  
He has a history of chronic lower back pain, and the left leg pain has been present 
for a few years.  He has been prescribed exercises which have little affect.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left S1 radiculopathy.  Mr. 
Smith has mechanical/discogenic lower back pain.  Lumbar MRI performed July 
23, 2021 reveals left L5-S1 disc herniation.
In view of the persisting left leg pain and the impact on his quality of life (he has not 
been able to work), I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. D. Guha.  For his back pain he could trial a course of spinal 
mobilization/manipulation with a chiropractor or manipulatively trained physical 
therapist.  A reasonable trial of treatment would be 10 sessions over a month or so.  
If his back pain remains disabling despite treatment, then consideration should be

correlates on his MRI.  His symptoms overall are not the most bothersome, but he
expressed his wishes today to proceed with surgery after discussing risks and benefits
for the procedure.  We discussed alternative options of physiotherapy, which he was not
keen on and had difficulty performing in the past, as well as ongoing injections, which
he said he has an inconsistent response to so far.  His primary concerns for management
was to reduce the amount of pain in his left calf primarily, as well as regain some
function especially for his recreational hobbies including golf and hockey.
 After fully discussing options as well as obtaining informed consent, which has been
signed, he is going to book for an elective surgery with left-sided L5-S1 foraminotomy
plus/minus microdiskectomy, minimally invasive surgery.  We will call him to book an OR
date, and he would also be interested in being on the cancellation list if possible.  In
the meantime, we have advised him to continue with injections as tolerated, as it appears
he has been benefiting from this quite a bit from his last injection.

Pain produced with Flexion
positive Smith's test on left
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left posterior thigh and calf pain which began 
in early 2020.  He has not experienced any significant improvement despite physical 
therapy.  He has limited walking and standing tolerance, and pain has affected his 
ability to do recreational activities.  His health in general is unremarkable other than 
hypotension and pre-diabetes.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left S1 
radiculopathy/radicular pain.  The lumbar MRI was performed March 16, 2021 and 
reveals severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1, and left lateral recess stenosis from 
disc protrusion.
Given the lack of improvement, impact of pain on his quality of life, and MRI findings, 
I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  He should 
be continuing with self-directed exercises.

the summer season and as such, he would like to defer surgery into the fall of this year.
We will hold off on booking him for now, but he will proceed by calling us back as well
as requesting a surgical date and anesthesia consult at that time.  The procedure will be
for right-sided L4-L5 minimally invasive surgery for foraminectomy plus/minus discectomy.
In the meantime, we have advised him to continue on his injections locally which provide
him approximately 6 weeks of pain relief.
 ",,"Mr. Smith presents with leg more than lower back pain.  He describes constant 
right lateral leg pain (burning) which began about 5 years ago.  He reports a 
cramping and lancinating pain at the posterior left thigh.  He has cramping in his 
calves.  He does not report his lower back pain to be a significant issue.  He had 
chiropractic care at first, but there was no lasting relief.  He has been receiving 
epidural injections every three months, with variable levels of relief.  He says that his 
sleep is not disrupted.  His health in general is good.  His standing tolerance is less 
than 5 minutes due to his symptoms.
The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith to be neurologically intact, other than 
mild weakness of the right EHL.  There is some nerve root tension on the right with 
slump testing.  Advanced imaging has not been performed, but plain films of the 
lumbar spine performed in 2018 reveal disc space loss at L5-S1.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5 
radiculopathy.  There may be L5 root irritation to account for the left leg pain.  Given 
the ongoing leg dominant pain and impact on his quality of life, I have requisitioned a 
lumbar MRI and will be following up with him after the MRI.  In the interim, he 
should be continuing with self-directed exercises and could pursue a course of 
manual treatment with a chiropractor or manually trained physical therapist for 
lower back pain.

than 5 minutes), and relief with lying down.  Exercises are not helpful.  Mr.

there is facet hypertrophy at L4-5 on the left with lateral recess stenosis and 
compression of the left L5 nerve root.

",,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of lower back pain.  She has had back 
pain since the age of 17 when she fell, but experienced an acute flare up of pain in 
April 2022 when she felt intense pain through her lower thoracic area spreading into 
the flanks.  She does not have any lower extremity pain, but does sometimes feel an 
ache through the right anterior thigh.  She has some paresthesia in the left great 
toe.  She has OA of the left knee, but her health is otherwise good.  She does not 
smoke.  She is not taking any pain relieving medication.  The only medication she is 
taking is estrogel.
The physical examination reveals her to be neurologically intact.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 
bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  She could heel and toe walk 
without difficulty and Smith test is unremarkable.  Vibration and position sense is 
preserved in the lower and upper limbs.  There is no clonus or spasticity, or other 
pyramidal signs.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  There is tenderness 
to segmental challenge in the lower lumbar spine.
A thoracic MRI was performed May 31, 2022.  There is a large disc protrusion at 
T10-11 with mass affect on the thecal sac and cord.  Xrays of the lumbar spine 
reveal degenerative disc disease at L5-S1 and L3-4.
Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back pain.  She has a thoracic disc herniation at 
T10-11 with mass affect on the cord.  The age of the herniation is unknown.  While 
she is neurologically normal on physical examination, the disc herniation will require 
monitoring.  I have requisitioned a CT scan to evaluate for any calcification and have 
referred her to Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine surgeon.  For her back pain, since 
she has not responded to chiropractic care, I have referred Ms. Smith to a pain 
clinic for medial branch/facet joint blocks.  She should be continuing with 
self-directed exercises.

Pain produced with Flexion
N/A
Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and posterior left thigh pain.  The 
onset was in April 2021 and he has not experienced any substantive improvement, 
despite exercises and a course of chiropractic care.  He does not report any change 
to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle 
anesthesia.  His health is otherwise good.  He is a non-smoker.  He is able to 
manage chores around the home, and is continuing to work.  He can no longer run.
The physical examination findings are commensurate with left L5 radiculopathy.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and 2+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  
Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, 
except for left EHL and to resisted foot dorsiflexion at 4+/5.  Hip ranges of motion 
are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.  There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 25, 2022.  There is an L4-5 large broad 
based disc protrusion with severe canal stenosis.  There is abutment and 
displacement of L5 nerve roots, more prominent on the left.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of a left L5 radiculopathy.  Given the ongoing pain, 
lack of improvement despite the passage of time, and impact on his quality of life, as 
well as MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr.

The pain travels to 
the medial leg to ankle and there is associated painful numbness.  The onset was 
more than a year ago with no substantive improvement despite chiropractic care and 
physical therapy.  He does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, 
and there is no perineal numbness.  His health in general is good.  He is a 
non-smoker.  He is allergic to codeine.  He continues to work as an Electrician.

stretch reflexes are 2+ except for the left patellar reflex which is 1+.  Power is 
graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished along the left L4 
dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.

canal stenosis at L4-5.  There is lateral recess stenosis and impingement of the left 
L5 nerve root.  There is moderate to severe left L4-5 foraminal stenosis.  There is a 
disc protrusion at T11-12 with signs of Smith.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of left L4 radiculopathy.  There are signs 
of Smith at T11-12 but no overt signs of myelopathy on physical examination.  
There are corresponding findings for the left L4 radiculopathy diagnosis on MRI

Her right leg pain has also largely resolved after a chiro session in Sept 2022 and she has remained pain free. She had full motor / sensory function on exam. At this time there is no role for surgery. She does have a herniated disk that would explain her radicular pain at the time but this has resolved without any surgery. She should continue current conservative management. If she becomes symptomatic again she should obtain a new MRI and be referred to us for reassessment.
 
Regarding her incidental finding of T7-8 disk indenting the cord, we explained to her that there is a lot of room for her cord in the canal and there is no signal changes on the cord. She also has no symptoms at that dermatome. She doesn't require an intervention for this. If she does become symptomatic we can reassess this with an MRI. We discussed this with patient and she understands",,"Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a right S1 radiculopathy.  There is 
corresponding finding on MRI.  Given the chronicity of symptoms and lack of

characterizes the pain as a burning, tingling and heaviness with limited walking 
tolerance of less than a block (less than 5 minutes of standing or walking).  She says 
that the pain has been present for a couple of years and is worsening.  She does not 
report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal 
numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She is doing several exercises, but has not had any 
formal physical therapy.  She is taking Pregabalin 75 mg 3 tab bid, and Tylenol xtra 
strength 2 to 4 per day.  Her medical history includes diabetes, essential 
hypertension and dyslipidemia.  Other medications include: atorvastatin, janumet, 
trazodone, candesartan, alendronate, jardiance.
The physical examination reveals that she could not toe walk due to the bunion on 
the right foot.  She was using a walker.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+, except for 
the left patellar reflex which is 2+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle

spinal canal stenosis at l4-5 and moderate right foraminal stenosis.  There is a grade 
I anterolisthesis at L4-5.  There is some canal stenosis at L3-4.
Ms. Smith presents with fairly classic symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  She will 
require a surgical consultation given her functional decline, but an updated MRI is 
required first.  This will reveal if there is any progression of the canal stenosis at 
L3-4. Standing xrays of the lumbar spine were performed today for pre-surgical 
planning.  I have requisitioned an MRI here at HGH as I work under medical 
directives.  However, given wait times at HGH, consideration could also be given to 
requisition of MRI elsewhere (perhaps GNMI) for a more expedited procedure, but 
requisition is deferred to her physician.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with 
flexion-based exercises.  I will be following up with her after the updated MRI.

cardiac procedures including ablations, 2 stents and a left bundle branch block.  She 
is hypothyroid.  Other medications include: estrogen/progesterone, bisoprolol, 
pantoprazole, and synthroid.
On physical examination her habitus is noted to be endomorphic.  There is lower 
back pain with lumbar spine extension.  She could heel and toe walk without

examination and MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  Once the buttock and leg pain is addressed and if

Ditto when she returns to the erect position she unfolds the thoracic spine first and then rolls the hips with the lumbar spine really not moving much at all.
 
I think we can help her with a two-level lumbosacral reconstruction to offload those involved disks.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and leg pain, with the right sided 
pain being 90% of her difficulties.  There is associated numbness in the right leg.  
She has a history of chronic lower back pain, but he leg symptoms have been 
present for several years.  The pain is worsening.  She has attended for osteopathic 
treatment which helps, and physical therapy has provided some relief.  She has also 
attended for injections which provides some relief.  She relates more recent onset of 
neck and right shoulder pain related to stress from financial concerns.  Ms. Smith's 
health in general is otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker.  She works as a 
Bookkeeper, but is having difficulty completing her work due to inability to sit for long 
periods.
The physical examination reveals her to be essentially neurologically intact.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  There is 
some weakness/fatiguability of the right calf to repeat single leg calf raises.  There is 
a positive straight leg raise on the right.  There is tenderness at the right L5-S1 level 
and at the sacroiliac joint.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and 
non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed November 20, 2021.  The cardinal findings are 
degenerative disc changes at L4-5 and L5-S1.  There is a right L5-S1 disc protrusion 
and impingement/mass affect on the right S1 nerve root.  There are modic changes 
at L4-5.
Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with right S1 nerve root 
irritation/radiculopathy.  She also has mechanical lower back pain related to 
degenerative disc and facet joint changes in the lower lumbar spine.  Given her 
limited response to conservative measures, at this time I am referring her for a 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to 
continue with self-directed exercises.  I query whether a neuromodulator such as 
Gabapentin would provide relief, as well as a sleep aid, perhaps Smith.  I 
defer further consideration to her physician.  There is no need for follow-up with 
myself and her surgical candidacy is deferred to Dr. Smith.

Given his clinical picture and significant functional impairment he has severe cervical myelopathy for which surgery would be indicated to prevent the progression of his illness and possibly improve his current symptoms. At his current state he is at high risk for falls and injury that could result in quadriplegia. We discussed the nature of his illness and the procedure, which would be C3-4 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right more than left leg pain.  He has 
limited walking tolerance and reports diminished balance and he has fallen.  He 
reports a  burning sensation at the front of his thighs and feet, with occasional 
lancinating pain.  He experiences spasms in his calves.  There is an increase in pain 
with sitting, standing and walking.  He is performing stretches and has found cold 
packs helpful.  Mr. Smith is attending at a pain clinic weekly for injections.  Mr. 
Smith is also reporting occasional tingling in his hands.  He has balance issues 
and uses a cane from time to time.  He is taking Lyrical 125 mg per day, and Tylenol 
xtra strength prn.  His health is reported to be otherwise good.  He does have a 
venous disorder of the left lower leg, possibly related to prior major trauma 
requiring ORIF.  He works in Customer Service but has not been able to return to 
work since January 24, 2022.
The physical examination findings are concerning for myelopathy.  Patellar reflexes 
are hyperreflexic and pathologic.  Upper limb reflexes are hyperreflexic.  There is 
positive Hoffman's sign bilaterally.  There is positive Smith and upgoing great toes 
bilaterally.  Power is 5/5 except for the right EHL and FHL.  Supine straight leg 
raising is non provocative.  Vibration sense (128 hz tuning fork) is diminished in the 
right foot.  Upper limb reflexes are 3+.  The pectoral reflexes are hyperreflexic.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Mr. Smith is unable to tandem walk 
and there is positive sharpened Smith test.
There are signs of myelopathy and concern regarding cervical spondylotic 
myelopathy.  Mr. Smith is in the right age category and there are clear long tract 
signs.  An cervical spine lesion would likely be cephalad to C4 given the hyperreflexic 
pectoral reflexes.  He also may have unilateral neurogenic claudication and there are 
signs of right L5 radiculopathy, but his lumbar spine is of secondary concern at this 
time.  He will require a spine surgical consultation, but MRI imaging of his cervical 
spine is required first.  I have referred him to Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon, in order 
not to delay the process and have requisitioned a cervical spine MRI.  Mr. Smith 
says that an updated lumbar MRI has already also been ordered.  I have 
recommended to Mr. Smith that he speak to his physician about getting the 
cervical spine elsewhere than HGH.  I work under medical directives and can only 
order it here at HGH where wait times can be long.  A much quicker alternative 
would be GNMI, but I defer the completion of the requisition to his primary care 
physician.  I told Mr. Smith to call me when the cervical MRI is complete and I 
can go over the findings with him.

The onset was 
in December 2021.  He feels that he is improving, however is not certain if this is 
related to medication that he is taking.  About a week ago he forgot to take his pain 
medication (Cymbalta 60 OD) for a day and pain intensely recurred.  He reports 
having occasional tingling sensation on the lateral of the left foot.  Mr. Smith tried 
physical therapy and massage without relief.  He works seasonally as a Chef, is 
currently working, and reports that standing is not too troublesome.  He is limited in 
walking and sitting for about 5 to 10 minutes.  Mr. Smith has essential 
hypertension and smokes about 3/4 pack of cigarettes per day.  He has undergone 
prior L4-5 discectomy in 2011 and total left hip replacement in 2013. He is not 
performing any specific back exercises, but is walking and remaining active.
Other medications include: Amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide, and rosuvastatin
The physical examination reveals his gait and cadence to be normal.  There is an 
increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  Mr. Smith could heel and toe walk without 
difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+, except for the left Achilles which is 1+.  
Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.

cardinal finding is a left paracentral disc protrusion at L5-S1 with caudal migration of 
disc material.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of left S1 radiculopathy.  At this time, given his

There is a small disc protrusion at L3-4.
Mr. Smith presents with fairly classic symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  There 
is marked spinal canal stenosis from epidural lipomatosis.  As a result of his 
symptoms and functional limitations Mr. Smith has gained weight.  I have strongly 
encouraged weight loss as this may also help with the epidural lipomatosis.  Given 
his ongoing functional difficulties, I am also referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that he consider 
stationary bicycling as he may be able to tolerate this better than walking for 
cardiovascular conditioning and to help with weight loss.

To surgically treat this fusion would be necessary.  And due to the sagittal imbalance correction the alignment would be necessary.  This will be fairly extensive procedure.  I did outline this to her.  And due to the high-grade spondylolisthesis there is possibility of L5 nerve root injury causing foot drop.
 
She thought about what I outlined.  She does not feel the symptoms are significantly bothersome enough for her to justify having surgery.
 
Therefore she can continue with nonoperative measures.",,"Ms. Checkley-Fearman presents with a complaint of lower back and left more than 
right leg pain.  She has a history of chronic lower back pain, and leg pains have been 
present for several years.  Her symptoms are worsening.  She relates limited 
walking tolerance of only about 5 to 10 minutes.  Exercises help a little.  She 
underwent a course of physical therapy a couple of years ago, but treatment only 
provided her with relief for a few hours.  She has been undergoing epidural 
injections every few months, and this helps for a few days.  Ms. Checkley-Fearman 
is able to void her bladder, but reports some perineal numbness.  Her medical 
history includes a history of breast cancer twice, and kidney cancer.  She has had a 
collapsed lung.  She is a non-smoker.  She is osteoporotic.
Medications include: Tylenol 3 prn, Tylenol xtra strength - 3 or 4 per week, and she 
also uses a multiprofen cream.  The only other medication she takes is risendronate.
The physical examination reveals normal gait.  She was not using any supports.  
There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+, except for the left Achilles reflex which is 1+.  Power is graded 5/5 
except for the EHL's bilaterally at 4+/5.  Sensation to sharp testing is reduced in the 
feet but in a non-dermatomal pattern.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits in a seated position.  Ms. 
Checkley-Fearman could not lie in a supine position, but slump testing did cause leg 
pain/nerve root tension bilaterally.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed February 10, 2022.  There is a Grade II/III L5-S1 
spondylolisthesis.  There is severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally.
Ms. Checkley-Fearman has signs and symptoms of bilateral L5 radiculopathy, and left 
S1 radiculopathy.  She has chronic back pain related to the significant 
spondylolisthesis.  In view of the worsening symptoms and lack of significant 
improvement with more conservative measures, including epidural injections, as well 
as the impact on her quality of life, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am 
referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She should continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

She can continue on with visit therapy if she finds this is helpful.,,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock and leg pain, and as distal 
as the foot.  She describes some weakness of the right foot and slight foot drop.  
The symptoms began insidiously about 2 years ago and she has not experienced any 
significant improvement.  She has been prescribed flexion based exercises, but these 
are not providing significant relief.  Her functioning is affected.  She used to go for 
long walks, but now her walking and standing tolerance is limited to 10 to 20 
minutes.  Her health is otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker.  She works as a

spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 with right subarticular recess stenosis, and severe right 
foraminal stenosis.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5/S1 radiculopathy.  There are 
corresponding findings on MRI.  Given her ongoing leg dominant pain, functional

We mutually agreed to pursue with surgical decompression. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right sided lower back and thigh pain.  
The onset was in November 2021.  The pain in the right thigh is described as a 
burning sensation, and lower back is an ache.  He relates that she has bladder 
retention and has to exert herself to void her bladder and bowel.  There is no saddle 
anesthesia.  She attended a pain clinic for injections without relief.  Physical therapy 
was not helpful.   She is able to get restful sleep.  Her medical history includes a 
history of seizures and migraine headaches.  She has essential hypertension.
On physical examination she presented in the accompaniment of her son.  She was 
using a walker.  She is significantly antalgic to the left.  Due to her mobility issues no 
supine testing was performed.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished 
along the right L3 dermatome.  Seated straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip 
external and internal rotation bilaterally was within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed April 21, 2022.  The images are substantially similar to 
prior study.  There is a right subarticular disc herniation at L1-2 and moderate canal 
stenosis.  There is moderate bilateral foraminal stenosis at L2-3.
Ms. Smith presents with right L2-3 radicular symptoms and there are structural spine 
changes that are causing her antalgia.  There is a degenerative listhesis of her 
spine.  Due to concern for possible vertebral collapse, I requisitioned standing plain 
films of the lumbar spine today and these do not reveal any further collapse.  There 
is demineralization.  There is a Grade I retrolisthesis of L2 on L3.  L2-3 and L4-5 disc 
spaces ae not well assessed due to spine orientation and demineralization.
Ms. Smith was in hospital in April and saw a resident for Dr. D. Guha, neurosurgeon.  
It was not felt that she had cauda equine syndrome and it was recommended that 
Ms. Smith follow-up with Dr. Guha in his outpatient clinic.  I agree with this 
recommendation, and while her age and bone quality would count against her being 
a likely surgical candidate, the consultation is nevertheless very reasonable.  I have 
encouraged her to perform activities to tolerance and she can apply hot or cold 
compresses if she finds relief.  She should continue to use the walker to minimize 
the chance for a fall.  Neurologically, I did not find any significant deficit.  I have also 
referred her to the DeGroote Pain Clinic for consideration of her candidacy for an 
epidural injection.

Most of her 
pain is left buttock and leg.  She has had several episodes, but this episode has 
lasted about 18 months and pain is worsening.  She has attended at ER on several 
occasions.  She has tried chiropractic care and physical therapy without relief.  Ms. 
Smith reports that her sleep is disrupted due to pain.  She has paresthesia in the 
left foot.  She works with disabled children and has significant difficulty completing 
her work.  She also had a job working in an office, but had to quit this job.  Other 
than a history of digestive problems, Ms. Smith says that her health is otherwise 
good.  She recently quit smoking.  She does not report any allergies.
Medications are limited to Smith 10 mg prn, not daily, and Tylenol 3 prn.
The physical examination reveals a young woman in obvious physical distress.  She 
was antalgic to the right.  She was using a cane.  There is an increase in pain with 
lumbar flexion.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ bilaterally at the patellae and Achilles.  
Power is graded 5/5 except for the left EHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved to sharp and light touch in all dermatomes.  
There is a positive straight leg raise on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits and pain free.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
and there are no pyramidal/long tract signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed June 29, 2022.  There is a disc herniation at L4-5, 
more prominent to the left and significant left lateral recess stenosis.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of left L5 radiculopathy.  Given the 
ongoing and worsening left leg dominant pain, the impact on her quality of life, the 
lack of response to conservative measures, along with examination and MRI findings, 
I am referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, 
she should continue with self-directed exercises and pain control measures.

And stenosis is quite mild on MRI.  Therefore would recommend referral to physiatry and neurophysiologic studies. The studies were done January 2022.  And they support L5 radiculopathy. Given this new information, I do think radiculopathy is more likely as a pain generator for him.  However given the fairly mild MRI findings I do think confirmatory tests are necessary before considering surgery. I've gone ahead and referred him for a right selective nerve root block of L5 at the DeGroote pain clinic.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock pain.  He uses to have leg 
pain to the foot but this has improved.  In June he had his right knee replaced and 
has just begun a course of rehabilitation.  He therefore is not certain if any residual 
pain in the right leg is related to his knee.  He is walking more and doing home 
based exercises.  Mr. Smith has had physical therapy in the past, and injections 
were helpful.  He is taking hydromorphone and other medications for pain relief, but 
cannot recall the names.  He is taking an statin and medication for anxiety, the name 
of which he could not recall.  He is a non smoker.  He cannot do chores at home.  He 
was working as a Forklift Operator, but is recovering from his knee surgery.
The physical examination reveals Mr. Smith is neurologically intact.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+.  Sensation is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Power is 
graded 5/5 except for some pain apprehension related to his right knee.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper 
limb reflexes are 2+, except triceps which are 3+.  Hoffman's sign is absent 
bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI performed September 16, 2021 reveals disc bulging at the right IVF at 
L4-5.  There is abutment of the right L5 nerve root.  There is significant right 
foraminal stenosis.
Mr. Smith is status post right knee replacement and had recently begun rehab.  It is 
possible that he has right L4 nerve root irritation that is causing right buttock pain.  
The pain is no longer lancinating into the lower leg.  I have recommended to Mr. 
Smith that he complete his rehab for the right knee and if the right leg pain recurs 
he could follow-up with me.  He should consider a course of physical therapy for the 
ongoing right buttock pain which may be related to right L4 nerve root irritation.

Given the severity of her symptoms I did offer her a discectomy.  At L5-S1 on the left.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The onset 
was in February 2022 and pain has been worsening.  This is despite having tried 
physical therapy and chiropractic care.  She does not report any change to bowel or 
bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  Pain can awaken her, and 
she finds the worst pain is first thing in the morning.  Her general medical history is 
otherwise unremarkable.  She has asthma and chronic bronchitis, but no recent 
bouts.  She is a non-smoker.  Ms. Smith was working in retail, but has not been able 
to return to work since May 2022.  She is limited in her ability to perform chores at 
home.
Medications for pain include Smith, Diclofenac and Pantoprazole.  Other 
medications include Wellbutrin 150 mg OD and Citalopram 20 mg.
The physical examination findings reveal that she walks with a normal gait.  She was 
not using any supports.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and 
extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the Patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  
Sensation is diminished along the left S1 dermatome.  There is weakness to 
attempted repeat left single leg calf raise.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
There are no trophic or vasomotor changes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the 
left.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits bilaterally and symptom free.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 17, 2022 at St. Joseph's hospital.  The cardinal 
finding is a left broad-based L5-S1 disc herniation.  This affects the lateral recess 
with compression of the S1 nerve root.
In view of the worsening left leg dominant pain despite the passage of time, the 
examination and MRI findings, and failure to respond to conservative care, I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also 
referred her for epidural injection to see if this may proffer her relief.  She should 
continue with activity to tolerance and self-directed exercises.

She is cautiously interested in the surgical alternative after I spent quite some time explaining the problem and proposed surgical care solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues.  She is given me consent accordingly",,"Ms. Smith presents today with a complaint of lower back and leg pain.  There is 
numbness in her calves and pain in the ankles.  She has had prior episodes of back 
pain, but feels that her leg pain has only been present since surgery for necrotizing 
fasciitis.  She relates having bladder problems due to muscle damage, but she is 
able to void.  There is no report of any perineal numbness.  Ms. Smith says that 
she has fallen a few times.  He has had massage and intramuscular injections 
without significant relief.  She has limited walking tolerance of less than 5 minutes 
due to leg pain and weakness.  She says that she has fallen on a few occasions.  Ms. 
Smith is not gainfully employed and last worked in 2020 as a caregiver.
The medical history includes necrotizing fasciitis affecting her buttock in 2020 which 
required tissue removal.  She has an ileostomy bag.  She has IDDM, essential 
hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day.  
She is allergies to some antibiotics and latex.
Medications for pain include Smith, 4 per day, and Gabapentin 600 mg tid.  Other 
medications include: insulin, novo rapid, toujeo, rabeprazole, propranolol, Ramipril, 
crestor, macrobid and Celebrex.
The physical examination reveals normal gait and cadence.  There is pain through 
the left posterior thigh with lumbar flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes 
are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation to sharp testing is reduced 
along the right lateral foot and left foot non-dermatomally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 
to S1, except for the left hamstrings which are 4+/5.  Straight leg raising and slump 
testing is positive on the left.  There is some crossover into the left with right SLR.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and symptom free.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
A lumbar MRI was performed July 4, 2022.  There is a grade I anterolisthesis of L4 
on L5.  There is a left foraminal disc protrusion at L4-5 with moderate foraminal 
stenosis, and midline L5-S1 disc herniation with compression of S1 nerve roots.  
There is degenerative disc disease at L5-S1.
Standing xrays of the lumbar spine performed today reveal Grade I anterolisthesis of 
L4 on L5 and severe loss of intervertebral disc height L5-S1.
Ms. Smith has mechanical lower back pain and signs and symptoms of left S1 
radiculopathy.  Given the unremitting pain and affect on her quality of life, as well as 
examination and imaging findings, I feel that it is appropriate that we seek spine 
surgical consultation.  I am referring Ms. Smith to Dr. Smith, orthopaedic spine 
surgeon, for his expert opinion.  She should continue with self-directed exercises.

He 
describes a burning and numbness.  Symptoms are chronic and he relates to me 
that he has had falls every few days with the left leg giving way.  There is no change 
to bowel or bladder functioning and no perineal numbness.  There is reported 
significant left leg weakness and difficulty performing exercises.  He has noticed 
diminished muscle mass of the left leg.  He has lower back pain at nighttime.  Mr. 
Rittenhouse says that he is scheduled to have CT and EMG investigations performed.
Review of his health history reveals that he has had prior lower back surgeries, three 
in total, including a fusion in the 1990s.  His health is otherwise good.  Mr. 
Rittenhouse is a non-smoker.  He has had his left ACL repaired.  He is retired and 
reports having difficulty completing chores at home.
Medications include: Baclofen, Nabilone, Pregabalin, Smith, and 
Methylprednisone injections.
Mr. Smith stands 5'11"" and weighs 205 lbs.  He walks with a limp favouring his 
left leg.  He uses a cane.  There is atrophy of the left quadriceps.  There is an 
increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+. 
Plantar responses are silent.  Power is 3+/5 of resisted left knee extension, 4+/5 of 
left knee flexion, 2+/5 of left ankle dorsiflexion and 1+/5 of the left EHL.  There is 
tenderness at the left Smith and there is a positive thigh thrust on the left.  Straight 
leg raising caused an increase in lower back pain, but not leg pain.  Femoral nerve 
stretch test was negative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There is no spasticity or 
clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 14, 2022.  From L3 to S1 images are 
non-diagnostic due to hardare artifact.  There is moderate canal stenosis at L2-3.
The physical examination is suggestive of left L3-4 radiculopathy and there appears 
to be left sacroiliac joint irritation.  I have recommended to Mr. Smith that I 
follow-up with him after the CT and EMG studies.  In the interim, he could try some 
manual mobilization/manipulation to his sacroiliac joints with a physical therapist or 
chiropractor.  I have also referred him to a pain clinic for consideration of medial 
branch/facet joint blocks.

time she was managing reasonably well.  Dr. Smith stated that if her symptoms 
progressed that an updated MRI would be in order and likely she would be a surgical

Ms. Smith is not taking any pain relieving medications.  She is taking 
pantoprazole, olmesartan 40 mg and crestor.  She has a history of chronic back 
pain.  She has essential hypertension, but her health is otherwise good.  She does

right varicose veins.
The physical examination reveals that Ms. Smith walks with a normal, reciprocal 
gait and she was not using any supports.  She stands 5'2"" and weighs 169 lbs.  
Active lumbar spine ranges of motion were non-provocative.  She could heel and toe 
walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles

canal stenosis at L2-3.  There is a degenerative anterolisthesis at L4-5.  On personal 
review of the images there appears to be disc material on the left at L5-S1 
compromising the lateral recess.
Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication, and there 
are some nerve root tension signs on the left.  There are corresponding findings on 
MRI that would account for her symptoms.  Given the lack of substantive 
improvement, the reports of intermittent perineal numbness, and the affect that the

The symptoms 
began in 2021 with yard work and he has not experienced any significant 
improvement.  He does relate that recent injections (2 sessions) at a pain clinic have 
helped a little, but that physical therapy and chiropractic care was not helpful.  
Decompression (traction) was not helpful.  There is no change to his bowel or 
bladder functioning, and no perineal numbness.  Mr. Smith is doing a few 
exercises intermittently.  His walking and standing tolerance is less than 5 minutes 
and he has been using a walker for about 3 weeks.
Review of his health history reveals that his health is otherwise good.  He does not 
smoke and does not have any known allergies.  He has had prior appendectomy and 
tonsillectomy.  The only medication he reports taking is Gabapentin 600 mg qhs, 600 
mg qam and 300 mg qpm.
On physical examination Mr. Smith stands 5'7"" and weighs 185 lbs.  He is using a 
walker and there is an anterior list of his torso.  There is an increase in pain with 
lumbar extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and Achilles

A lumbar MRI was performed May 14, 2022.  The cardinal findings are severe spinal 
canal stenosis at L2-3 and moderate at L3-4.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  
In view of his very limited standing and walking tolerance, the lack of response to 
conservative care, and the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine 
surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He can continue with the injections if he

We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include  continuing to live with symptoms, multimodal analgesia, physical therapy and other conservative measures, injections  And surgery  . 
 
Given her symptoms predate her current MRI, some further information is required, and I have therefore requisitioned an updated MRI as well as CT scan of the lumbar spine from GNMI.  I have also sent her for scoliosis and flexion-extension x-rays today.
 
In the meantime to further elucidate her main pain generators I would advise in staged fashion, 1) bilateral image guided L2-3 transforaminal epidural steroid injections, 2) left L4-5 image guided transforaminal epidural steroid injection, 3) multilevel facet injections plus minus ablation.  She is already seeing Mrs. The pain clinic and will get in touch with them next week for these.
 
Once she has completed the injections as well as obtain the updated imaging she knows to call my office should she not obtain adequate or durable relief from injections and we can then discuss surgical options, which would likely involve a larger operation along the lines of an L1-5 posterior decompression and instrumented fusion.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain, and pain and paresthesia 
into the left lower limb as far as the great toe.  The onset was in May 2022 and 
while conservative therapies do provide some relief, she does not indicate any 
significant improvement overall.  She notes some progressive weakness and foot 
drop of the left foot.  There is an increase in pain at night. She does find being in 
water helpful.  There is no change to bowel or bladder function, but she notes 
urinary frequency.  There is no saddle anesthesia or perineal numbness.  She has 
been prescribed exercises.  She is able to manage her ADLs, but has had to hire a 
housecleaner.
Medications for pain include: Lyrica 75 mg bid, Tramacet prn qhs, and Tramadol 200 
mg.  Other medications include: Smith, Smith, Voltaren, Synthroid and Pantaloc.
Her medical history is remarkable for SLE, hypothyroidism, Sjrogen's, and 
hypotension.  She is allergic to sulpha and codeine,  She is a non-smoker.  Prior 
surgeries include: hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, and laparoscopies.
On physical examination Ms. Smith presents using a cane in her right hand.  
Bunions are noted in both feet with erythema.  Her habitus is Smith.  There 
is an increase in pain with flexion and extension of the lumbar spine.  She could not 
perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 except for left foot dorsiflexion 
which was 4+/5 and left EHL 2/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Supine straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's 
sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed December 20, 2021 at Brantford General.  The 
cardinal findings are severe DDD at L2-3.  There is spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 and 
synovial cyst.  There is left L4-5 foraminal stenosis.  There is a superior disc 
extrusion at L1-2.
Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication and there are signs of left L5 
radiculopathy.  Her back pain is mechanical.  I explained to her that surgical 
intervention is more likely to help her lower extremity symptoms rather than back 
pain.  I am concerned about progressive left foot weakness and given the ongoing 
leg pain, the examination and MRI findings, and continuing impact on her quality of 
life, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I 
have also referred her to the Mississauga Pain Clinic for consideration of medial 
branch block and rhizotomy to hopefully help with her back pain.  She has found 
some relief with osteopathy and she can continue with this if she finds relief.  I have 
encouraged her to continue with self-directed exercises.

The patient understands the nature of her disease and symptoms. We discussed with the patient alternative treatments such as physiotherapy, steroid injection and conservative management. We also discussed surgical management specifically the risks, benefits and post operative expectations. The patient understands that the main goal of surgery is to stabilize/decrease saddle anesthesia and neuropathic pain. No significant improvement in foot drop is expected after surgery, due to the chronicity of this weakness. She understands that there is a small chance that surgery worsen or do not change her symptoms.
 
The patient consented to Open decompression/laminectomy/discectomy (2 level L3-4,L4-5, +/- other levels)
",,"Ms. Smith present with a complaint of buttock and leg pain, worse on the left side.  
There is pain into the left great toe and numbness in the left leg.  She has significant 
weakness of the left foot and has been prescribed an AFO.  She relates incomplete 
voiding and some perineal numbness.  Ms. Smith says that the leg pain and foot 
weakness began in April.  She had some physical therapy without relief and has tried 
stretches without relief.  Her sitting and walking tolerance is reported to be 5 to 10 
minutes.  
Ms. Smith's medical history is remarkable for essential hypertension and 
dyslipidemia.  She had breast cancer about 20 years ago and had a mastectomy.  
She does not smoke and does not have any allergies.  Prior surgeries are reported 
limited to the mastectomy and hysterectomy.  Ms. Smith can only do very light 
chores at home.
Ms. Smith presented using an AFO on the left foot.  Active lumbar spine ranges of 
motion are non-provocative.  She could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power L2 to 
S1 bilaterally was graded 5/5, except for left foot dorsiflexion and EHL at 0/5.  There 
is negative straight leg raising bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal 
limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A Doppler study did not reveal any vascular insufficiency.  A lumbar MRI was 
performed May 18, 2022 and there is multilevel spinal canal and foraminal stenosis, 
worst at L4-5.  There is severe inferior L5-S1 and L4-5 foraminal stenosis, with 
significant lateral recess stenosis at L4-5, worse on the left.
Ms. Smith presents with sign and symptoms of left leg radiculopathy and foot drop.  
Given the lack of improvement in pain, motor deficit, examination and MRI findings, I 
am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. G. Guha.  She should 
continue using the AFO and perform activities to tolerance.  She does report 
incomplete bladder voiding and is also reporting some perineal numbness, and given 
this and the weakness, and I have asked Dr. Guha's office to expedite the 
consultation.  Should she experience an inability to void she should seek immediate 
medical attention.

tolerance is 5 to 10 minutes.  Mr. Smith does not report any change to bowel or 
bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.   He 
does Aquatherapy which he finds helpful.  He has also had epidural injections which 
provided him with some relief.  He continues with self-directed exercises at home.   
He is very limited with his ability to any chores at home.

first.  I have requisitioned the MRI, but I work under medical directives here at HGH 
where the wait times can be long.  He may wish to consider discussing with his 
physician about a requisition elsewhere with shorter wait times.  Mr. Smith should

and she reports that pain is worsening.  The pain travels as distal as the plantar 
aspect of the forefoot.  She describes a few episodes of incontinence and some 
urinary urgency, but there is no retention.  She describes some perineal numbness.  
Ms. Smith did have a course of physical therapy without relief.  She has 
been prescribes exercises which she is doing.  She has not had any injections.  She 
reports that her standing and walking tolerance is 5 to 10 minutes, and sitting is 10

medication she takes is pantaloc.
Ms. Smith works as  Case Worker and is working.  She works from home 
and utilizes a sit/stand desk.

There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  She could not perform heel and toe 
walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+, except for the left Achilles reflex which is 
1+.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 except for flexor halluces on the left which is

finding is a large left L5-S1 disc herniation and significant compromise of the lateral 
recess.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a left S1 radiculopathy.  
Given the worsening of left leg dominant pain despite the passage of time, the lack 
of response to conservative care, the examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  In the interim, 
she should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

The lower back 
pain began with a fall in January 2022 and there was no significant leg pain at that 
time.  In March she was placed on a more strenuous job at work which involved 
repetitive lumbar flexion, and this is when the leg pain began.  Currently, the leg 
pain is worsening and she reports some urinary retention with pain, but this may be 
related to some other UTI issue.  There is no perineal numbness.  She has had 
chiropractic care for upper back and neck pain which helps, but treatment for her 
lower back (some type of supine maneuver) has not back pain.  She attends for 
physical therapy weekly consisting of dry needling and decompression (traction).  
Ms. Smith is also performing self-directed exercises at home.  She has not had any 
injections.  Ms. Smith continues to work, but has been provided with modified 
duties on a different line.
Her health is reported to be otherwise good.  She has a history of reflex syncope due 
to low blood pressure.  She does not have any known allergies and does not smoke.  
Prior surgeries include: hysterectomy (July 6, 2022), breast reduction, left ankle 
ORIF, tubal ligation and wisdom teeth removal.
Medications include: Naprosen 500 mg bid, Pregabalin 25 mg 2 tab qhs, and 
Milodrine 5 mg qid.
Ms. Smith walks with a normal gait and was not using any supports.  There is no 
antalgia.  An increase in pain was reported with lumbar flexion.  She could heel and 
toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the left EHL 
which is 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  Muscle tone 
and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is 
negative bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 17, 2022 at St. Joseph's hospital.  The cardinal 
finding is a left paracentral disc protrusion at L4-5 with abutment and minimal 
displacement of the left L5 nerve root.
Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a left L5 radiculopathy. There is 
corresponding finding on MRI.  She continues to be significantly impeded due to leg 
dominant pain, and has not been able to return to her regular work duties.  Given 
the leg dominant worsening pain, the examination and MRI findings, and given that it 
has been 5 months with no substantive relief with conservative care, I am referring 
Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation.  She is being referred to Dr. Smith, 
neurosurgeon.  In the interim, for her back pain she should trial up to 10 sessions of 
side posture spinal manipulation.  She should be continuing with home-based 
exercises.

He does have he does have typical degenerative changes.  With some facet arthropathy at L4-5 as well as L5-S1.  But no significant nerve root impingement.
 
For the lumbar spine I recommend active physical therapy program.
 
With respect of the cervical spine, the patient shows very mild signs of cervical myelopathy.  At most he has some mild intrinsic hand muscle weakness.  However what is concerning is the dynamic movements that cause worsening paresthesias and numbness in his hands.
 
We had a lengthy discussion today.  I would like to get an EMG study to reassess his carpal tunnel versus a C6 or C7 radiculopathy.
 
And then will have a follow-up appointment.  Clearly stated to undergo surgery will be to prevent any microinjury from dynamic movements in his cervical spine due to the significant C6-7 spinal stenosis.  One consideration could be an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and right leg pain, and 
diminished balance.  The chief complaint today however, is neck and shoulder pain, 
with a constant pressure sensation about his clavicles.  He describes diminished 
strength in his hands and occasional numbness in his fingers.  He is able to void his 
bladder and there is no saddle anesthesia.  Mr. Smith reports that his back pain 
can awaken him.  He describes leg achiness.  He works as a Construction Manager 
and is continuing to work.
His health history reveals that he has a history of depression.  Mr. Smith is a 
non-smoker.  He does not have any allergies, but does have an intolerance to 
NSAIDs.  Surgeries include: cholecystectomy, tonsillectomy, and ulcer.  The only 
medication he takes for pain is Tylenol prn.  He is also taking Viibryd.
The physical examination reveals that Mr. Smith has a flattened affect.  He stands 
5'11"" and weighs 210 lbs.  His gait and cadence is normal.  Active lumbar spine 
ranges of motion are non-provocative.  He could heel and toe walk.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 
bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished at the left foot, but the distribution was 
non-dermatomal.  Vibration sense in the feet is diminished but present.  Hip ranges 
of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A cervical and lumbar MRI was performed August 27, 2022.  There is severe canal 
and foraminal stenosis at C6-7 with cord signal change.  There is degenerative disc 
changes at C5-6 and C6-7.  There are multilevel lumbar degenerative changes.  
There is severe left L5-S1 facet osteoarthritis.  There is right L4-5 foraminal 
stenosis.
Mr. Smith presents with mechanical lower back pain, and there are subtle long 
tract signs.  There is spinal cord compression at C6-7 from a combination of 
degenerative changes.  I have referred Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith.  I have also referred him to a pain clinic for consideration medial 
branch blocks and/or RF ablation of his lower lumbar spine.

We did discuss that surgery is generally not very effective for numbness alone, and given her stable and mild motor weakness, the natural history of potential improvement in her motor weakness is likely similar with or without surgery given that her weakness has been persistent since June.  She therefore elected to continue with conservative therapy however knows to call the office should there be a recurrence of her radicular pain, at which point she may require an updated MRI, and possible consideration of L5-S1 discectomy.

Ms. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of right L5 and S1 radiculopathy.  
This is attributed to the large disc herniation at L5-S1.  While she has experiencing

At least 2 injections.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back, buttock and left leg pain.  The 
pain can travel as distal as the ankle, but is usually proximal to the knee.  The onset 
was in 2020 and increased in the fall of 2021.  Pain can sometimes disturb her sleep.  
She has found some relief with chiropractic care and exercises, and she applies hot 
and cold packs at home which is helpful.  Ms. Smith has had an epidural injection 
which was not helpful.  She is taking Gabapentin 300 mg tid which is helpful.
The physical examination reveals that her gait and cadence is normal.  There is no 
antalgia.  An increase in back pain is reported with lumbar extension.  She could 
heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's 
sign is absent bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished in the left L5 dermatome.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges 
of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed April 8, 2022 at Buffalo MRI.  There is a disc bulge at 
L4-5 and severe right and moderate left foraminal stenosis at the same level.  There 
is lateral recess stenosis and encroachment upon the L4 and L5 nerve roots.  The 
cardinal finding appears to be severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms and there are signs of left L5 nerve root irritation.  
At this point, given the persisting leg dominant pain, MRI and examination results, 
failure to adequately respond to conservative care and epidural injection, and the 
significant impact that symptoms are having on her quality of life, I am referring Ms. 
Eves for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  She can continue with 
chiropractic care if she finds benefit, and should be continuing with self-directed 
exercises.

Mr. Smith says that he is scheduled for a lumbar MRI March 5, 2022.  I suspect that 
there may be a disc protrusion at L2-3 or L3-4.  I have recommended to him that I 
follow-up with him after the MRI to determine next steps.  I have encouraged 
ongoing daily performance of self-directed exercises.

We had a lengthy discussion about operative and nonoperative management strategies.  She feels that she is exhausted her nonoperative management strategies at this time.–We offered her a L4-S1 decompression and fusion with an L5-S1 interbody fusion.,,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain and lancination pain into 
her legs.  She describes the leg pains as most troublesome.  She has a history of 
chronic lower back pain, but leg pains have been present for about 6 months.  
Exercises are not helping much.  She has not had any physical therapy or 
chiropractic care.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit, other 
than weakness of the right EHL and to resisted right foot dorsiflexion.  A CT scan of 
the lumbar spine reveals a Grade II spondylolisthesis at L5-S1 and severe bilateral 
foraminal stenosis.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing L5 radiculopathy.  Given the 
worsening leg dominant pain and imaging findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  I have also requisitioned a lumbar 
MRI.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to consider a course of manual physical therapy 
to see if a trial of treatment (perhaps 10 sessions over a month) will have impact.  I 
have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with self-directed exercises.

Investigation of an MRI is suggestive of a query dural AV fistula and T-spine dorsal
cystic lesion.  In terms of his lumbar spine, the patient requires an updated MRI because
at this point there is really no target that would explain the patient's lower back and
radicular pain.  Thus, we are going to ask Dr. Dos Santos to perform a repeat lumbar
spine to reinvestigate any structural cause of the patient's radiculopathy.  In terms of
his thoracic lesion, we are going to refer the patient for a CT myelogram with delayed
phase to assess for arachnoid cyst versus arachnoid web.  The patient's MRI of the lumbar
spine is to also include a thoracic component with gadolinium to assess for an
extramedullary lesion.  The patient will be also having an MRA component to
MRI to assess for the dural AV fistula or any evaluation.  We are also going to refer the
patient to the Interventional Neuroradiology team for consideration for a digital

There is corresponding finding on MRI from July 2020 of left lateral recess stenosis 
at L5-S1.
In view of the ongoing leg dominant pain and impact on his quality of life, as well as 
the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D.

Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and right leg pain to the 
ankle.  The pain is chronic but worsening.  She has had physical therapy in Moldova 
(Tens, acupuncture) without relief.  She has also had injections without relief.  
Chiropractic care in the remote past only provided temporary relief.  Her medical 
history includes having had lumbar surgery about 25 years ago.  Ms. Smith 
continues with her work as a Programmer and is able to manage light chores at 
home.
The physical examination findings suggest right L4/5 radiculopathy.  A lumbar MRI 
was performed in April 2019 and this only revealed mild canal stenosis at L2-3 and 
L3-4, with no other significant abnormality.
Given the persisting leg pain and lack of response to conservative care, I have 
requisitioned an updated lumbar MRI and will be following up with Ms. Smith 
post-MRI.  In the interim, she should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of right buttock and leg pain.  The onset 
was about 1.5 years ago and pain is worsening.  He characterizes the pain as a 
burning or sharp pain which is constant.  He has had chiropractic care and physical 
therapy which he finds helps maintain his mobility, but has not significantly impacted 
on his pain.  His health in general is good.
The physical examination findings are consistent with a right L5 radiculopathy.  
There is corresponding finding on MRI of a right L4-5 disc herniation.

trial an injection first and; therefore, I will make a referral to Pain Clinic for a

N/A
Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of right leg pain which began about 2 years 
ago.  She has found some benefit from physical therapy and chiropractic care.  She 
describes pain through the posterior thigh, and muscle spasms at the lateral right 
leg.  There is burning sensation at the plantar aspect of the right foot.  Her health 
otherwise is good other than a history of ulcerative colitis.
The physical examination does not reveal any significant neurological deficit.  There 
is nerve root tension on the right.  A lumbar MRI was performed September 5, 2021 
which reveals right L3-4 disc herniation.
Ms. Smith is concerned about the persistence of pain and impact on her quality of 
life, including her inability to complete her chores at home.  Given this, the 
persistence of leg dominant pain, the examination and MRI findings, I am referring 
Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  I have encouraged her 
to continue with self-directed exercises and she can continue with chiropractic care 
and physical therapy should she find benefit.

She 
has had chronic lower back pain since 1984, but the leg pain has only been present for 
about a year.  She feels that symptoms are worsening.  She has limited standing tolerance 
of less than five minutes.  She had prolotherapy without relief.  Dr. Smith has done 
epidurals which did provide relief, but have not been as effective lately.  Recent injections 
around her coccyx area have provided relief.  She has also had laser therapy with some 
relief.
Review of her health history reveals a history of fibromyalgia and RA.  She has essential 
hypertension.  She has chronic venous insufficiency in her legs and edema.  She is 
borderline diabetic.  She is allergic to penicillin.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.  She has chronic 
coccydynia.  She has had both knees replaced and has had surgery on her feet.  She reports 
to me that she has been using a walker for about 8 years.  She is able to manage light 
chores around the home.
Medications include simpori, methotrexate, leucovorin calcium, sollifenacin, furosemide, 
irbesartan, clonidine.  For pain she is taking hydromorphone 2 mg up to 5 per day, 
hydromorph contin 3 mg - 2 per day, extra strength Tylenol 4 per day.
The physical examination reveals Ms. Smith's habitus to be endomorphic.  She was using a 
walker.  Edema is noted of her lower legs and ankles.  There is an increase in back pain with 
flexion.  Sensation is diminished in the feet in a non-dermatomal pattern.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power L2 to S1 was 5/5 bilaterally, 
except for the right EHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg 
raising is negative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
An MRI of the lumbar spine was performed at GNMI on September 15, 2022.  The cardinal 
findings are: right L4-5 synovial cyst and lateral recess stenosis.  Left L3-4 lateral recess 
stenosis, and severe right L5-S1 foraminal stenosis.
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  Given the 
worsening leg symptoms despite more conservative treatments, and in view of the MRI 
findings, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. D. Guha.  She 
should be continuing with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

There is a Grade I listhesis at L3-4 and L4-5.  There is severe canal stenosis at L4-5 and 
moderate at L2-3.  There is severe facet arthropathy at multiple levels.  There is a left L5-S1 
disc bulge and displacement of the left S1 nerve root.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of left S1 radiculopathy.  There is significant spinal 
stenosis at L4-5 and L2-3, but my impression is that her buttock and leg pain is largely 
stemming from the L5-S1 level.  Her difficulties navigating stairs may be more related to 
her knees for which she awaits a surgical consultation.  Given the ongoing left lower 
extremity pain and failure to respond to conservative care, I am referring Ms. Smith for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with 
self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

She had brief relief from injection. She is a candidate for L4-5 left decompression which would provide her relief from her leg dominant symptoms. We did also advise her in regards to infection risk especially given that she is a smoker and have advised that she quit smoking ideally. We have also obtained x-rays of the lumbar spine for pre-operative planning. 
 
We discussed complications including, but not limited to: dural tear; infection; wound complications; bleeding; injury to: major vessels, major organs; nerve root injury; weakness; numbness; bowel or bladder dysfunction; failure to improve symptoms; adjacent segment degeneration; instability; revision surgery; wrong-level surgery; blood clot; anesthesia-related risks such as pulmonary/cardiac/cerebrovascular complications, including death, paralysis and blindness.
 
We did take a look at her MRI of the cervical spine and there was no stenosis that would require operative intervention. Given her history of chiari malformation we would recommend a cranial neurosurgery consultation to determine whether that is the source of her pain. She would also benefit from a physiatry consultation in regards to her neck and upper extremity pain. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a chief complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The pain is 
characterized as an ache and there is occasional sharp pain through the lower back.  There 
is numbness at the great toe.  The onset was years ago and pain is worsening.  She has 
limited walking and standing tolerance.  Physical therapy and acupuncture provided 
temporary relief.  Ms. Smith continues with yoga exercises.  She reports a secondary 
complaint of numbness and ache in the right arm.
Her medical history is remarkable only for hypothyroidism.  She has a chiari malformation.  
She smokes about 1/2 pack of cigarettes per day.  There are no known allergies.  Her 
surgical history includes: right sholder, endometriosis, tubal ligation, and breast reduction.
The physical examination reveals that she walks with a normal gait.  Active lumbar spine 
ranges of motion are non-provocative.  She could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  
Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 
L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for the left EHL which is graded 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished 
along the left L5 dermatome.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is 
non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+, except for sluggishness of the right triceps.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There 
are no long tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was perforemd May 19, 2022.  The cardinal finding is left L4-5 foraminal and 
lateral recess stenosis/narrowing.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing left L5 radiculopathy.  This is related 
to the lateral recess stenosis at L4-5 and compromise of the L5 nerve root.  Given her failure 
to adequately respond to conservative care, functional limitations, my examination and MRI 
results, I am referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, 
she should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

Functionally she is improved as well quite a bit but she still is limited to certain degree.  She is not happy with her progress but is willing to give it another 8 weeks given the trajectory of her improvement and see how she does.  I discussed the benefits and risks of conservative versus a redo decompression versus even a TLIF and we will revisit these options in about 8 weeks time.

of the first and second digits.  The pain began in July 2022 and have not improved.  There is 
an increase in pain with walking and standing.  Lying down provides relief.  Ms. Smith does 
not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  
Exercises are not helping.  Review of her health history reveals that she had a right L4-5 
microdiskectomy in 2013 with good results.  Her health his otherwise good.  There are no 
known allergies and she does not smoke.  The only other surgery reported is tonsillectomy.  
Ms. Smith is able to manage light chores at home.
Medications include: Flexeril 10 mg and Lyrica 50 mg tid
The physical examination reveals that she walks with the aid of crutches to offload the right 
leg.  She stands 5'4"" and weighs 130 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion 
and extension.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ except for the right Achilles which is 1+.  
Sensation is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is positive on the right.  There is some crossover with left 
SLR.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes ae 2+ and

Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of right L5 radiculopathy and there is corresponding 
finding on MRI.  Given the MRI findings and that her pain remains disabling, I am referring 
her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Consideration could be given to 
referring her for epidural injection which may help with pain control.  She should continue

It sounds like after the cervical decompression her right leg had improved.  She was having hyperreflexia and upper motor neuron type symptoms involving her trunk and legs.  Some of the symptoms have remained including tingling in her lower extremity.  I advised the patient that some of her symptoms may always remain this way since I see evidence of T2 signal change within the spinal cord in her cervical thoracic junction.
 
Her lower back pain and tightness around that area is likely from degenerative changes and will unlikely respond to surgical intervention.  What I may be able to offer, is decompression at L3-4 level to see if we could improve her leg symptoms especially triggered with ambulation.  I asked the patient if improvement in her leg only with decreased pain during walking would be enough for the patient.  She was reasonable with her expectations and was keen on proceeding with surgery.  I discussed the procedure itself including the surgery and expected recovery.
 
The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries.  No guarantees were given or implied, the patient understands that her symptoms may not significantly improve after decompression of the lumbar region. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L3-4 laminectomy.
 
My office will arrange surgery in our next available OR time.  In the meantime, to help with her back pain she could consider seeing pain clinic in the Niagara region for trigger point and/or epidural steroid injections.  This would be fairly safe and may help give her additional relief.  Over 50 minutes were spent face-to-face with the patient during today's visit.  It was a pleasure seeing  Sandra Ellen Rainville  in clinic today.  Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain and paresthesia in her legs.  
There is associated weakness.  She describes a band of tightness around her waist (this was 
present prior to cervical spine surgery July 21, 2021).  There is burning midline lower back 
pain.  Ms. Smith has sought physical therapy without relief.  As noted, she had cervical 
spine surgery in 2021 and this improved her right leg motor control issues.  There has been 
increasing left leg and foot tingling and numbness, and there is left leg paresthesia with 
walking/standing. 
Her health is reportedly otherwise good.  She is allergic to penicillin.  She does not smoke.  
She has had total right hip replacement.  She had C9-T1 decompression/fusion July 21, 
2021.  Other surgeries include c-section and breast reduction.  Ms. Smith is retired.  She 
has difficulty with chores at home.
Medications include Gabapentin 900 mg/day, Baclofen and NSAID.
Ms. Smith presented using a cane.  Her gait is slow.  She could not perform heel/toe 
walk.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally, but there is 4 
beats of clonus bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for weakness 
3+/5 of the EHLs bilaterally and to resisted left ankle dorsiflexion 4+/5.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished in the feet in a non-dermatomal pattern.  
Vibration sensation (128 hz tuning fork) was diminished in the feet.  Straight leg raising is 
non-provocative.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed at Niagara Health April 29, 2022.  There is moderate to severe 
L3-4 canal stenosis.  There is left lateral recess stenosis and severe foraminal stenosis.  An 
MRI of the cervical spine was perrformed June 20, 2022.  There is focal cord signal 
abnormality at C7-T1.  There are multiple levels of foraminal stenosis.  An MRI of the 
thoracic and cervical spine was performed June 21, 2022.  There is cord compression at C7-
T1.  Thoracic spine is unremarkable. 
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms of unilateral neurogenic claudication.  There are long 
tract/pyramidal signs, but I am not certain if this is residual to her prior cervical spine 
surgery.  I have requisitioned a cervical spine MRI with contrast.  Consideration could be 
given to referring her to a pain clinic for possible medial branch/facet joint blocks.  I am 
referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  She 
should continue with activity to tolerance and self-directed exercises.

The back pain is chronic, but leg symptoms 
began about 1 year ago.  The pain is mostly through the posterior thighs and there is 
associated weakness and heaviness.  There are increased symptoms with walking, and relief 
with sitting.  She is able to void and there is no perineal numbness.  She does have some 
urinary urgency.  She has been attending at St. Joseph's hospital for RF ablations for her 
back which she finds helpful.  She continues with self-directed exercises.  Her walking and 
standing tolerance is less than 5 minutes.
Review of her health history reveals that she has diabetes and essential hypertension.  She 
is a non-smoker.  There are seasonal allergies.  Her surgical history includes having both 
hips replaced, and left total knee replacement.  She is able to manage chores at home.  She 
was previously swimming.  She has been using a walker for about a year.
The physical examination reveals her to be using the walker.  There is an increase in pain 
with lumbar spine extension.  She could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 2+ at the patellae adn Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 except 
for the right quadriceps which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion 
are within normal limits and non-provocative.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There 
are no long tract signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed at St. Joseph's hospital on March 24, 2022.  There is multilevel 
degenerative anterolisthesis.  There is multilevel epidural lipomatosis.  There is severe canal 
stenosis at L3-4 and severe facet OA at L4-5.  There is mild to moderate canal stenosis at L2
-3.
Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication.  This is related to the epidural 
lipomatosis.  While I am not certain given this etiology what the prognosis would be with 
any surgical intervention, nevertheless a surgical consultation is reasonable in view of her 
functional limitations.  I am referring Ms. Smith to Dr. Smith for his expert opinion.  
She should be continuing with self-directed exercises.

does.  Her health history includes advanced OA of the knees and she says that her 
knee surgeon will be performing knee replacement surgery, but wanted to have her 
lumbar spine addressed first.
Other than the knee OA, her health history includes dyslipidemia and essential 
hypertension.  She is allergic to Demerol.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.  She relates 
that she has never had any surgeries.

any supports.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  She could 
not perform heel and toe walking.  There is some non-pitting edema at the ankles 
and feet .  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are 
within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent

stenosis at L3-4 and moderate to severe at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative 
changes.  There is severe foraminal stenosis at L3-4.  Xrays of the lumbar spine 
performed July 22, 2021 reveal a convex right lumbar scoliosis and graded I 
anterolisthesis L4 on L5. 
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms and functional limitations commensurate with 
neurogenic claudication.  There are corresponding findings on MRI with severe canal 
stenosis.  I have encouraged her to continue with self-directed flexion-based 
exercises, and have also referred her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.

The lumbar spine itself is nontender despite diffuse high-grade paralumbar spasm there and he can marginally, erect when asked.  There is no asymmetry of diffusely poor bulk and tone in the buttocks thighs or calves with uniform areflexia at the ankles and knees, negative distracted distracted straight leg raising in the feet are well-perfused with no long tract signs.
 
Plain x-rays show diffuse oligotrophic spondylosis in good alignment and a recent MRI shows surprisingly high-grade mixed central and neuroforaminal stenosis at all levels bracketing L2-5.  There is some significant degenerative lumbar scoliosis as well. That scoliosis is very important here, we have all kinds of fluoroscopic images from his pain clinic injections going back 6 years the do not show any deformity at all, or least none to speak of.  Today's standing x-rays confirm a major dynamic instability in this man spine so in addition to decompression he will need instrumented stabilization bracketing those levels for otherwise prohibitive risk of a post decompressive instability.
 
With his wife attending of explained the problem and proposed surgical care solution with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues.  He is cautiously interested in going ahead to surgery but I am just as cautious and very much want him to get cardiac screening done before we would approach the operating room I will be sending him to Dr. Sebastian Rivas for that.

buttocks and posterior thighs, and he reports limited walking tolerance of 40 to 50 yards.  
The pain is chronic but worsening.  He has some relief for about 4 weeks with epidural 
injections.  He does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no 
perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.
Medications for pain include Tylenol 3 2q6hrs, and Arthrotec 50 mg bid.  Other medications 
include Smith, Symbicort, Smith, hydrochlorothiazide, pantoprazole, myrbetriq.  
His health history reveals asthma and essential hypertension.  He is a non-smoker.  There 
are no known allergies.  Mr. Smith's surgical history includes: left Smith in 2021 and he is 
scheduled for the right.  Other surgeries include: lobectomy, hernia, colonoscopy, TURP, 
and bilateral shoulder surgery.

and weighs 163 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  He 
could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is graded 
5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Hip ranges of motion are

There is advanced facet OA at L4-5 and also arthropathy at L3-4 and L5-S1.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms of neurogenic claudication.  His back pain is mechanical 
and related to the degenerative scoliosis.  Given his significant functional limitations and 
the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He has also had injections at the DeGroote Pain Clinic and I recommended he

Some of this may be consistent with S1 radiculopathy.  I had a long conversation with the surgery about the utility of surgery.  I explained to him that and that they are on the fence about surgical intervention.  It is possible that he had a larger disc herniation in the past that may have caused more acute sciatica.  At this point there is some evidence of ongoing healing and the nerve root is contacting the disc bulge but not being actively compressed.  That being said there may be an element of inflammation or scarring that may contribute to some of his leg pain.  If surgery were to be entertained and L5-S1 hemilaminectomy and microdiscectomy would be an option.  This is primarily to perform neurolysis and perform resection of the nucleus pulposus.  In some patients this may improve their leg pain while in others it does not help as much if the nerve itself is causing neuropathic pain in the absence of physical irritation. 
 
The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. 
 
All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning.   The patient wishes to proceed with surgery with understanding it may not help much with his pain but he would like to take the chance. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L5-S1 hemilaminectomy right sided approach with microdisectomy.  It was a pleasure seeing  Adam Donald Crane  in clinic today.  Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back and posterior thigh pain.  The onset was 
a few years ago, but pain is more constant lately as of May 2022.  He does not report any 
change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is no perineal numbness.  He is doing 
exercises which do not provide relief.  He has not had any formal physical therapies.  Pain 
tends to awaken him.
Medications for pain include diclofenac and lyrica.  Other medications include ramipril and 
xarelto.
His health history reveals a history of essential hypertension.  He had blood clots in his 
lungs about 6 years ago.  He smokes about a pack of cigarettes per day.  His surgical 
history includes tibial/fibular osteotomy and bilateral shoulder surgery.  He has 
environmental allergies.
The physical examination reveals him to walk with the aid of a cane.  He stands 6'0"" and 
weighs 175 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar extension.  He could not perform 
heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles 
bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
Sensation is diminished along the right L5 and S1 dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion are 
within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  
There are no long tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed May 5, 2022 at St. Joseph's Hospital.  The cardinal finding is 
an L5-S1 midline and right paracentral disc protrusion.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of right S1 radiculopathy.  Given the ongoing leg pain 
and functional limitations, as well as examination and MRI findings, I am referring him for 
spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  I have also referred him for a 
course of physical therapy at Mac2Hope clinics.  In addition, I have referred him to a pain

She should try coming down on the Celebrex as well as the Lyrica further.
 
If her symptoms worsen and she like to have neurosurgical invention, please repeat MRI scan I will gladly reassess her.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of buttock and posterior thigh pain.  The onset 
was in June 2022 and she has experienced some improvement since having an epidural 
injection.  She continues to experience paresthesia in her feet .  Physical therapy has helped 
a little and there is no disruption of sleep.  There is no change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and no perineal numbness.  She is able to manage her daily activities with 
pacing.
Her medical history is remarkable for diabetes and essential hypertension.  She does not 
have any allergies.  Ms. Smith does not smoke.  She relates not having any 
surgeries.
Medication for pain is limited to Pregabalin 100 mg qhs at this point.  She was previously 
taking Smith and Celecoxib.  Other medications include: Jardiance 25 mg, Janumet 
1000/100 mg, Glicazide MR 30 mg, Coversyl 8 mg, Simvastatin 5 mg.
On physical examination Ms. Smith was observed to walk with a normal, reciprocal 
gait.  She was not using any supports.  She stands 5'2"" and weighs 125 lbs.  She could heel 
and toe walk without difficulty and there were no balance issues.  Power was graded 5/5 L2 
to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+ and Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There is 
no spasticity or clonus.
A lumbar MRI was performed September 7, 2022 at GNMI.  The images reveal severe spinal 
canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is moderate to 
severe foraminal stenosis bilaterally at L4-5 and L5-S1.
Ms. Smith presents with buttock and posterior thigh pain, along with paresthesia in 
her feet.  She has experienced some improvement since having an epidural injection the 
beginning of September.  Her symptoms are commensurate with neurogenic claudication 
and there are MRI findings to account for this.  We had a long discussion about next steps.  
Given that her symptoms only seemed to have improved with the epidural and with 
Pregabalin, as well as the imaging findings, and concern regarding deterioration in her 
functioning, I am referring her for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the 
interim, she should continue with flexion-based exercises and activity to tolerance.

I discussed with the patient the surgical option of an L4-5 hemilaminectomy with bilateral decompression.  Our focus would mainly on the right side in order to adequately decompress the right L5 nerve root.
 
The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L4-5 hemilaminectomy, right sided approach.

improving.  She does not report any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and there is 
no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She has tried chiropractic care without relief, 
and exercises are not helping.  Her medical history reveals episodic back pain in the past.  
She has CLL diagnosed about 8 years ago, but says that recent blood work is good.  She has

We did offer surgical intervention in the form of an L3-4 laminectomy for decompression of the nerve and possible resection of the cystic lesion.  We discussed that if the lesion was in fact coming from the covering of the nerve then we would not be resecting it as this would put him at risk of spinal fluid leak.  However if this was in fact a disc fragment then it would be easily resectable.  We discussed indications and risks of the procedure including but not limited to injury to spinal nerves, CSF leak, lack of improvement in symptoms, bleeding, infection, possible redo operation, as well as risks of general anesthetic.  He weighed all of his options as was more interested in pursuing epidural steroid injections initially and he would think about surgery.  We will refer him to the Bloor pain clinic for left L3-4 transforaminal epidural steroid injections. ",,"Mr. Smith was seen initially September 30, 2022.  He reported left buttock, thigh and 
lateral knee pain.  The onset was in early August with lifting.  He has had physical therapy 
and chiropractic care without relief.  He is able to get restful sleep.  His health history is only 
remarkable for epilepsy.  Mr. Smith is a non-smoker.  He is limited in his ability to do 
chores at home.
The physical examination reveals that he stands 183 cm and weighs 87 kg.  His gait and 
cadence is normal.  There is an increase in pain with flexion.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+.  
Power is 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left, and there is some 
crossover with right SLR.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  I noted that 
a lumbar MRI was performed at GNMI on September 20, 2022.  There is a left L3-4 T2 
enhancing lesion in the lateral recess.  The radiologist provides differentials of possible 
nerve sheath tumour or synovial cyst.  On personal review of the images I felt it may be disc 
material with atypical enhancement given the history of onset.  Mr. Smith was diagnosed 
wtih left leg radicular symptoms with L4 nerve root involvement.  An MRI with contrast was 
requisitioned and I was to follow up with him post MRI.  I encouraged him to continue with 
self-directed exercises.
On follow-up today Mr. Smith says that his pain remains the same.  There continues to be 
left buttock and left thigh pain to the lateral knee, and some pain in the leg.  As noted, he 
has not experienced any significant relief with conservative management.  He is able to get 
restorative sleep.  He estimated having experienced 20 to 25% improvement.  He is not 
taking any pain relieving medication.
The MRI with contrast was performed October 11, 2022.  The radiologist notes the T2 
hyperintense lesion at L3-4, but favours within differentials an extruded disc.  This fits with 
the history and my impression.
At this point, given the limited improvement, functional limitations, and imaging findings, I 
am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  He should 
continue with exercises and activity to tolerance.

which has been present for about 5 months.  She is able to get restorative sleep, but the 
pain can be significant up to almost 10/10 at times.  Walking and standing tend to 
exacerbate the pain, and her tolerances are less than 5 minutes.  She is limited in her ability 
to perform chores at home. 
Her medical history is unremarkable other than hypertension and dyslipidemia.  She is a 
non-smoker.  Her surgical history includes: hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, squamous cell 
carcinoma, and surgery for prolapsed bowel.  
She is taking Pregabalin 75 mg bid for pain.  Other medications include: omeprazole, 
ramipril, amlodipine, atorvastatin.

Ms. Smith has symptoms that are commensurate with unilateral neurogenic claudication, 
and there are some signs of left L4 radiculopathy.  Given the unremitting and disabling 
nature of the leg dominant pain, I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation

Clinically I would have expected this to be more along an L4 nerve root distribution.  However, based on imaging it relieve the L5 nerve root on the left side is involved.  There appears to be a broad base disc herniation resulting in lateral recess stenosis at L5.  This accounts well for his chronic and waxing/waning symptoms.  Overall his quality of life is impacted and he feels that the leg pain takes a significant portion his overall discomfort. 
 
We discussed surgical options for this in the form of an L4-5 Hemilaminectomy and microdiscectomy.  The primary goal of surgery is to decompress the nerve root and help alleviate his leg pain.  It may not make a dramatic impact to his low back pain. The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L4-5 hemilaminectomy and microdiscectomy with left-sided approach.
 
The patient has been placed on the elective list for a future surgical date.  If his symptoms improve in the meantime he can call my office to take himself off of the surgical wait list.  I also recommended that he give gabapentin or pregabalin to try to see if this will help with his symptoms.  I have advised him to get in touch with his family physician Dr. Elliott if he is interested in either of these medications.  It was a pleasure seeing  Douglas Anthony Alaimo  in clinic today.  Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient.",Not had Sx yet,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back, left buttock and leg (posterior thigh) 
pain.  The onset was a couple of years ago, but much more intense over the past year.  
There is no report of any change to bowel or bladder functioning, and no perineal 
numbness.  Physical therapy and chiropractic care have provided only very transient relief.  
He is continuing with stretching exercises.  Mr. Smith says that he had an epidural 
injection about 3 days ago and it seems to have provided some relief.  
Mr. Smith is not taking any medications.  His health in general is good.  He does not have 
any known allergies.  He is a non-smoker.  The only surgery he reports having had was a 
tonsillectomy.  He works in construction and is working modified with no heavy lifting.
The physical examination reveals that his gait and cadence is normal.  He was not using any 
supports.  He stands 6'1"" and weighs 200 lbs.  Active lumbar ranges of motion were non-
provocative.  He could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ 
at the patellae and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Muscle 
tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg 
raising is non-provocative and Smith's test did not precipitate any increase in leg pain.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign 
is absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed November 29, 2021 at Niagara General.  There is a left L4-5 
disc protrusion with compromise of the left lateral recess and what appears to be 
displacement of the left L5 nerve root.
Mr. Smith has symptoms consistent with left L5 nerve root irritation.  Given the 
unremitting pain which has not responded to conservative care and the passage of time, as 
well as the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue with self-directed exercises.

The only potential source of trouble is the dehydrated lumbosacral disc but even that does not look so bad in terms of inflammatory changes surrounding it and I should recall for everybody that the scan goes back to last April presenting today he is telling me that for just 2weeks ""my legs do not feel so good"".  I really do not know what that means.
 
Prognosis here is poor with any kind of surgical care the gentleman obviously has a massive component of symptom amplification and furthermore has a compensation related complaint, I have heard multiple times that ""compensation will not help cut out that they denied me… I have money no money to live anywhere… I am living on a driveway…"" Etc. etc.
 
When all was said and done I learned that he is got plans to fly back to British Columbia for some reason just on December 8, I do not expect we will be able to get any update MRI imaging that might explain his acuity and that kind of a timeframe at all and I spent quite some time suggesting he go into his local ER in BC to follow-up for care but he is asked me to try to put an order in for an MRI here and is claims he be willing to come back to it despite the fact that he does not have any money.
 
I am greatly challenged here by the social situation.
 
Best I can offer is to put in a requisition for an update MRI scan which I am happy to do.  I have told him that but again explained I think it be much better off going into his local emergency room to seek care in the environment where he is going to be for the next little while.
 
If he gets the scan done here I will look forward to reviewing it with him further when he comes to me.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a chief complaint of right buttock pain and into the posterior thigh. 
 The onset was about 2 years ago, and he has had several lower back injuries.  He relates 
that his pain is worsening and he has not been able to return to his work as a Diesel 
Mechanic for several months.  Exercises have not been particularly helpful.  There is no 
change to bowel or bladder functioning, and no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  
The medical history is reported to be otherwise good.  He is a smoker.  There are no known 
allergies.  He has had ORIF of the right arm.
Mr. Smith walks with a limp favouring the right leg.  He is using a back support.  He stands 
6'0"" and weighs 185 lbs.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  He could heel 
and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and Achilles 
bilaterally.  Sensation is diminished along the right S1 dermatome.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 
to S1 bilaterally, except for the left FHL which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical. 
 Straight leg raising is positive on the right.  Slump testing is positive on the right.  Hip 
ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is 
absent bilaterally.  There is no clonus or spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed April 9, 2022 at St. Catharines General.  The cardinal finding is 
a right L5-S1 disc herniation with abutment of the right S1 nerve root.
Mr. Smith presents with signs and symptoms of a right S1 radiculopathy.  His symptoms 
have not improved with time and have prevented him from returning to work.  In view of 
this, the examination and MRI findings, I am referring him for a spine surgical consultation 
with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should continue with self-directed exercises.

My recommendation would be to refer the patient for a left L5 selective nerve root block x2.

She does have chronic lower back pain.  She 
has essential hypertension.  She is allergic to sulpha.  Ms. Smith is a non-smoker.  She has 
had both knees replaced.
The physical examination reveals that she walks with a slight limp favouring the left leg.  
She is using a cane.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  She 
could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 
1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of 
motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent

A lumbar MRI was performed at GNMI on July 4, 2022.  The cardinal findings on personal 
review appear to be advanced left  lateral recess stenosis at L5-S1 and also L4-5 due to a 
combination of degenerative changes.  Smith's disease is noted.  There is moderate right 
and moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis at L5-S1. 
Ms. Smith has left leg radicular symptoms and unilateral neurogenic claudication.  It is my 
impression that this is related to the lateral recess stenosis at L5-S1 and L4-5.  Given the 
lack of substantive improvement despite the passage of time and the examination findings, 
I am referring Ms. Smith for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, 
she should continue with self-directed exercises, and physical therapy and chiropractic care 
if she finds it helpful.

March 2022 and he has not experienced any significant relief.  This is despite attending for 
physical therapy.  Epidural injections (2) provided relief for about a month.  Mr. Smith says 
his sleep is disturbed due to lower back pain.  He is very limited in his ability to perform 
chores at home.

very limited functioning and walking/standing tolerance.  He uses a cane and has a walker 
at home.  The MRI reveals severe canal stenosis at L3-4 and physical therapy has not helped 
very much in improving his functioning.  I therefore am referring Mr. Smith for spine

Her symptoms are concordant with her imaging which demonstrates dynamic instability. We had a lengthy discussion regarding the range of options, which include continuing to live with symptoms, following up with her pain clinic referral, or surgical management, which was offered in the form of a T12 kyphoplasty. She has an upcoming trip to Serbia and would like to continue to live with her symptoms at this time. Should she change her mind and wish to pursue surgery, we can revisit her case at that time. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of lower back pain.  The onset was as a result of a 
fall in the summer of 2021.  She has experienced improvement and estimates it at 50%.  She 
has not had any physical therapies, but did have injections (intramuscular?) in Serbia which 
helped.  There tends to be an increase in pain with transitioning from lying down to 
standing.  There is no change to bowel or bladder functioning, and no perineal numbness.  
Ms. Smith reports to me that she is scheduled to have a bone mineral density study this 
week.
Ms. Smith is not taking any pain relieving medications.  She is taking clonazepam and 
citralopram.  She has a history of depression and is pre-diabetic, but her health his 
otherwise good.  She is a non-smoker and does not have any known allergies.  The only 
surgery she reports having had was to her hand.  She has difficulty with bending and 
performing chores at home.
Ms. Smith stands 175 cm and weighs 90 kg.  Her gait and cadence is normal.  There is 
no antalgia.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar flexion.  She could heel and toe walk 
without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles 
bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within 
normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  There are no long 
tract/pyramidal signs.
Plain film radiographs of the lumbar spine were performed July 4, 2021.  There is a 
compression fracture of T12 of uncertain age.
Ms. Smith is status post T12 compression fracture.  She has mechanical lower back pain.  
Up to date xrays were performed today and there is progression of the compression 
fracture and marked wedging at T12.  Notwithstanding that more than a year  has elapsed 
since her fall, I feel it reasonable that we obtain an opinion as to whether she may be a 
candidate for kyphoplasty.  I am referring her for Dr. D. Guha.  Concomitantly, I am referring 
her to a pain clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet joint blocks to see if this may 
help with her back pain.  She should be continuing with self-directed exercises.  She could 
consider gentle spinal mobilization to the lower lumbar spine on a trial basis of perhaps 6 
to 8 sessions over a month.  The results of the bone mineral density study will be of help to 
Dr. Guha in his clinical decision making.

Recommend doing left L5-S1 microdiscectomy.  Possible complications being dural tear with CSF leak, postoperative hematoma, wound fracture, blood loss, blood transfusion, injury to nerve roots",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain.  The onset was in 
January 2022 and pain is worsening.  There are no changes to bowel or bladder functioning, 
and no perineal numbness.  She had an epidural injection August 17, 2022 with no relief.  
She has been prescribed exercises which are not helping much.  She had a prior history of 
right sided sciatica in the past which resolved.  Her medical history reveals a history of 
addiction to pain relievers.  She is an ex smoker.  She has seasonal allergies.  Her surgical 
history includes breast augmentation and liposuction.  She was working as a PSW but has 
not been able to return to work.  She cannot complete her chores at home.
Medications include: Baclofen, Lyrica 450 mg/day, Voltaren and Methadone (since 2002).
Ms. Smith stands 5'5"" and weighs 120 lbs.  She is using a cane.  There is an increase in 
pain with lumbar flexion and extension.  She could not perform heel walking.  There is 
weakness to repeat left single leg calf raise.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae 
and 2+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Power is 5/5 L2
 to S1 bilaterally, except for the left FHL which is 4/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  
Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and pain free.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of a left S1 radiculopathy.  An MRI performed at GNMI 
on February 26, 2022 reveals a cardinal finding of a left L5-S1 disc protrusion.  Given the 
worsening of leg dominant pain, examination and MRI findings, I am referring Ms. Smith 
for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, she should continue with 
self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

This is not a good situation to be in correctional surgery would be a massive and very high risk for catastrophe a couple of different ways.  Honestly I delayed the man in his assessment here today as I wrestled with all the imaging try to figure out how much I need to do for him but also how little I can get away with to try to control his morbidity risk.  I think I can spare the lumbosacral joint and I need to go all the way up to L5.
 
We talked at some length about the magnitude of this intervention and the considerable risks attached to it including death and paralysis which are very real things in a case like this.  Honestly am not enthusiastic about it, it will be a massive surgery in a very large man like this.  I reiterated to them that I see nothing here that is immediately threatening paralysis or other neurological catastrophe but he is dead set on ""I cannot live like this"" and wants me to look at going ahead to surgery.
 
Upfront I have to to tell him that his risk for silent end-stage cardiac disease is enormous by his risk factor profile and enforced inactivity so I very much want him to have cardiac screening done before we would look at going anywhere close to an operating room.  I will be since referring him to Sebastian Rivas and I caster for that and see him back if the cardiologist give us a go ahead at which point we can make our decisions and care plan.",,"Mr. Smith is taking Tramadol and Naprosyn for pain relief.  Other medications include: 
Duloxetine 90 mb OD, Amlodipine 5 mg HS, Gabapentin 900 mg tid, and Aripiprazole 2 mg 
OD.
Review of the health history reveals that Mr. Smith has essential hypertension and 
compassion fatigue.  He does not have any allergies.  He is a non-smoker.  His surgical 
history includes: left lung tumor removal, left Smith and Smith, left ankle surgery, 
cholecystectomy and appendectomy.
The physical examination reveals that Mr. Smith is endomorphic.  His gait reveals mild left 
foot drop.  Active lumbar spine ranges of motion are non-provocative.  He could not 
perform heel walking on the left.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and 2+ at 
the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1, except for the left EHL 4/5 and 
resisted left foot dorsiflexion 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  
Straight leg raising is non-provocative.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  There are no long 
tract/pyramidal signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed May 9, 2022 at Niagara Health Systems.  There is multilevel 
degenerative changes.  There is a left convex scoliotic curve and advanced facet joint 
arthropathy in the lower lumbar spine.  There is left lateral recess stenosis at L4-5.
Mr. Smith presents with mechanical lower back pain related to the degenerative scoliosis 
and facet joint degeneration.  There are signs of left L5 radiculopathy.  The symptoms into 
the buttocks and posterior thighs is neurogenic or possibly scleratogenous from the 
degenerative changes.  At this point, given the significant impact on his functioning and 
quality of life that pain is having, and notwithstanding the back dominance of the pain, but 
in view of imaging findings, I think it reasonable that we obtain a spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  Concomitantly, I have referred Mr. Smith to a pain clinic 
for consideration of medial branch blocks and/or rhizotomy.   I have encouraged Mr. 
Smith to continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.  He cannot walk 
for distance but may wish to try cycling.  Weight loss is encouraged.  I recommend blood 
testing for fasting glucose, TSH and B12 levels.  Consideration could be given to an AFO for 
the left foot drop.

He does not describe any pain radiating to his foot or ankle or anywhere below his knee.  Certain element of claudication as well as an element of L4 possibly L3 radicular leg symptoms
 
Hence I gave a prescription today to give to his pain doctor to do left-sided L4 and L3 transforaminal epidural steroid injections.  After he had those injections done he will contact my office",,"Mr. Smith presents with a history of back, buttock and proximal thigh pain.  The majority 
of his pain is in the buttocks, mostly left.  He can no longer run due to his symptoms.  The 
onset of symptoms was about 1 year ago and is worsening.  There is no urinary retention or 
perineal numbness, but there is some bowel urgency.  He tried chiropractic care without 
relief and continues with self directed exercises.  He works as an Air Traffic Controller and 
continues to work.
Mr. Smith is taking Advil 1600 mg per day for pain relief.  Other medications include 
ezetimibe, ticagrelor, and esomeprazole.  His health history includes having a cardiac stent 
implanted.  He has environment allergies.  He does not smoke.  He has a histoyr of labral 
tear of the right hip.  His surgical history includes ACL repair and septoplasty, in addition to 
the cardiac stent.
Mr. Smith stands 6'0"" and weighs 200 lbs.  His gait and cadence is normal.  There was no 
antalgia.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  Mr. Smith could heel 
and tow walk without difficulty.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion were within normal limits.  There is a 
positive FADIR test on the right.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent.  
Straight leg raising on the left caused left buttock pain.  Right SLR is unremarkable.  There is 
tenderness at the lumbo-sacral junction and over the superior gluteal musculature.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 15, 2022 at GNMI.  There is moderate to severe L3-4 
canal stenosis from a combination of degenerative changes.  It is my opinion that the 
cardinal finding may be in fact the L5-S1 level where there is disc degeneration and severe 
bilateral foraminal stenosis.  There is also a retrolisthesis at this same level.
Mr. Smith has predominantly buttock and sometimes pain into the proximal thighs, worse 
on the left.  His symptoms are not typical for neurogenic claudication.  Rather, I believe that 
his symptoms may in fact be stemming from the L5-S1 level and L5 nerve root irritation.  
Given the worsening pain, lack of response to chiropractic care and exercises, and imaging 
findings, I am referring him for spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  
I have recommended that he continue with flexion based exercises.  I have also referred him 
to a pain clinic for consideration of transforaminal epidural injection and possible medial 
branch blocks.

This is secondary to L4-5 and to some extent L3-4 central canal stenosis.  He likely has an element of congenital canal narrowing coupled with ligamentum hypertrophy due to degenerative changes.  The surgical option here would be a L3-5 laminectomy and decompression.  This will need to be bilateral since his central canal is quite tight and it is compressed on both sides. 
 
The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for 3 4, L4-5 laminectomy for bilateral decompression.
 
My office will organize surgery in our next available elective time.  In the meantime he can continue with the self-directed flexion-based exercises and physio to help with symptom relief.

any supports.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar extension.  He could heel and toe 
walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and 1+ at the Achilles 
bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all 
dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits and pain free.  Upper limb 
reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  Straight leg raising is non-provocative.
A lumbar MRI was performed June 22, 2022 at Trillium Health Partners.  The cardinal 
finding is severe canal and foraminal stenosis at L3-4 and L4-5.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  Given the 
ongoing leg dominant pain and functional limitations, as well as the lack of response to 
conservative care and the MRI findings, I am referring Mr. Smith for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith.  In the interim, he should be continuing with self-directed 
flexion based exercises.

We explained the natural history of the condition, which usually resolves in a few months. We discussed both surgical and non-surgical options. Given that the patient is in a significant amount of pain, we have consented her for surgery, which would entail an L5-S1 diskectomy. Should her symptoms improve over the next few months, she is welcome to cancel the operation. 
 
We reviewed the risks of surgery including infection, risk of damage to nearby structures, post-operative pain and numbness as well as anesthetic risks including MI, anaphylaxis, and death. 
 
The patient was agreeable to the plan moving forward. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg to the lateral toes.  The pain 
started as lower back pain about a year ago and the left leg pain has been present for a 
couple of months.  She has not experienced any significant improvement, and in fact 
reports pain is worsening.  She does not report any change to bowel or bladder 
functioning, and there is no perineal numbness or saddle anesthesia.  She has tried physical 
therapies, chiropractic care, massage and acupuncture without relief.  She has had recent 
intramuscular injection without relief, and is scheduled for epidural injection in December.  
She is not performing any exercises.  She cannot work and can only do very light chores at 
home.
Medication for pain includes: Pregabalin 50 mg qhs and Tylenol 2 1 q6h.  Her health is 
reported to be otherwise good.  She is allergic to gluten.  She smokes about 1/2 pack of 
cigarettes per day.  The only surgery she reports having had was a c-section.
The physical examination reveals that she walks with a limp favouring her left leg and was 
in very obvious physical distress.  She sat antalgic to the right.  There is an increase in pain 
with flexion and extension of the lumbar spine.  She could heel and toe walk.  Muscle 
stretch reflexes are 2+ at the patellae and right Achilles, but 1+ on the left.  Power is graded 
5/5 L2 to S1 bilaterally, except for left FHL which is 4+/5.  Sensation is diminished along the 
left S1 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 
2+.  Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.  Straight leg raising is positive on the left.
A lumbar MRI was performed August 22, 2022 at KMH.  There is a very large L5-S1 more 
prominent on the left side but filling most of the spinal canal and some possible 
compromise of the sacral nerve roots.
Ms. Smith has signs and symptoms of worsening left S1 radiculopathy.  Given the disabling 
nature of her worsening pain, examination and imaging findings, I am referring her for 
spine surgical consultation.  Fortunately, Dr. Smith was in the clinic today and agreed to 
see her.  Further comment is deferred to Dr. Smith's consultation.  Ms. Smith should be 
performing activities to tolerance.  She asked me about medications and I recommended 
she consult with her physician about possibly increasing the dose of the Pregabalin, and 
perhaps a tricyclic such as Smith to help her sleep.

Based on imaging summary the L5 nerve root that potentially has surgical pathology.  I am somewhat on the fence about how effective surgery may be given that the L4-5 disc protrusion did not look all that impressive.  Conversely the L5-S1 far lateral disc would require an instrumentation and fusion procedure which is more invasive and and requires longer recovery. 
 
I explained surgery in detail to the patient and walked him through my thought process.  The patient has not tried any gabapentin or Lyrica in the past.  He is amenable to this.  As such I am giving him a prescription for Lyrica 75 mg p.o. twice daily to try.  The patient would like to still entertain the surgical option despite the uncertainty regarding the extent of pain relief he may receive. 
 
The details of surgery were discussed with the patient.  The risks were also discussed which include but are not limited to the risk of bleeding, infection, risk of general anesthesia.  There are small risk of injury to the neural elements which may result in permanent weakness, sensory change or in the rare circumstances even paralysis.  There is small risk of bowel or bladder dysfunction as a result of this as well.  There is also risk of CSF leak necessitating repeat surgical repair. If bleeding or infection becomes significant he may require additional revision surgeries. All questions were answered and understanding was ascertained through the lines of questioning. The risks, benefits and alternatives were discussed with patient and informed consent was obtained for L45 hemilaminectomy left-sided approach with possible microdiscectomy.
 
The patient will give Lyrica a try first.  If his pain significantly improves then we can defer surgery.  However if he finds that the pain relief still it is not adequate and we can continue to keep the midline for next available elective OR time.  It was a pleasure seeing  Johnny Hendrick Bentley  in clinic today.  Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient.",,"Mr. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain which began in 
December 2021.  Despite trying physical therapy, chiropractic care and osteopathy, he has 
not experienced any substantive improvement.  There is no reported change to bowel or 
bladder functioning, and no perineal numbness.  Mr. Smith is continuing to perform 
stretching exercises at home.  He has not undergone any injections.  He is able to get 
restful sleep, but pain can awaken him if he rolls over.
He is taking an anti-inflammatory medication, the name of which he could not recall.  He is 
also taking Tylenol for pain relief.
The health history reveals that he is otherwise healthy.  He smokes 2 to 3 cigarettes per day. 
 There are no known allergies.  He says that he has not had any surgeries of significance.  
He continues to work and has a sit/stand desk that he uses.
Mr. Smith was greeted in the reception area.  His gait and cadence was normal.  He was 
not using any supports.  He stands 5'11"" and weighs 210 lbs.  There is an increase in pain 
with lumbar spine flexion.  He could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 1+ at the patellae and 2+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2 to 
S1, except for the left EHL which is 4/5.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 and S1 
dermatomes.  Hip ranges of motion are full with no pain.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  
Hoffman's sign is absent bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed at St. Joseph's Hospital on June 6, 2022.  There is a disc 
protrusion at L4-5, more prominent on the left.  There is impingement of the left L5 nerve 
root.
Mr. Smith has signs and symptoms of left L5 radiculopathy.  There is corresponding 
finding on MRI.  Given the ongoing leg dominant pain, failure to respond to conservative 
care and time, the examination and imaging findings, I am referring him for spine surgical 
consultation with Dr. Smith, neurosurgeon.  I have also referred him for epidural injection 
to see if this may proffer him some relief.  He should continue with self-directed exercises.

occasional shooting pain.  He also has lower back pain.  He reports that he has had right 
foot drop since April.  He does not report any change to his bowel or bladder control and 
there is no saddle anesthesia or any perineal numbness.  There tends to be an increase in 
right leg pain with walking and standing and relieved with sitting.  He is not currently taking 
any pain relieving medications.  The only medication he takes is perindopril for 
hypertension.  His walking and standing tolerance is 5 to 10 minutes.
Other than the hypertension his health is reportedly good.  He does not have any known 
allergies and is a non-smoker.  Surgical history includes a cholecystectomy and surgery to 
the right shoulder.  He works as a police officer but is currently working light duties.  He is 
scheduled to retire next June.
On physical examination Mr. Smith presents with a normal gait and was not using any 
supports.  He stands 5 feet 11 inches and weighs 245 pounds.  There was an increase in 
pain with lumbar spine extension.  He could not perform heel and toe walking.  Reflexes are 
1+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 except for the right foot 
dorsiflexion and EHL which were both 4/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation 
is diminished along the right L5 dermatome.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits

An EMG was performed August 19, 2022 and this reveals a right L5-S1 radiculopathy.  A 
lumbar MRI was performed September 13, 2022 and this reveals moderate canal stenosis at 
L3-4 with severe facet osteoarthritis at L4-5 and moderate to severe left and moderate right 
foraminal stenosis at L5-S1.  There is severe right foraminal stenosis at L4-5.  There is 
advanced degenerative disc disease and Modic changes at L5-S1.  There is lateral recess 
stenosis on the right at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing right sided neurogenic 
claudication and a progressive foot drop.  Given the progression of the foot drop and 
concern for worsening, as well as limited walking and standing tolerance, I am referring him 
for a surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  Mr. Smith could consider a course of  
manual physical therapy for his lower back to address any lower back pain.  He should

year ago.  He does have a history of chronic lower back pain.  His symptoms are 
exacerbated with with walking and standing and relieved with sitting.  Flexion is also 
helpful.  He does not report any change to his bowel or bladder control and there is no 
perineal numbness or any saddle anesthesia.  He reports that he has not had any therapy.  
Medications include baclofen, naproxen, Tylenol 3 as needed, extra strength Tylenol about 
4/day and pregabalin 150 mg twice daily.
Other medications include Entresto, bisoprolol, furosemide, azathioprine, atorvastatin, 
rabeprazole, aspirin, and Jardiance.
Review of his medical history reveals a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia.  Mr. 
Smith is able to manage light chores at home.
He was greeted in the reception area and was observed to be using a cane to help himself 
ambulate.  His habitus is endomorphic.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar spine 
extension.  He could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch reflexes are 2+ at 
the patella and 1+ at the Achilles bilaterally.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  
Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1.  Straight leg raising is negative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion 
are within normal limits and upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is negative Hoffmann sign 
bilaterally.
Lumbar MRI was performed that Smith MRI on September 20, 2022.  This reveals severe 
spinal canal stenosis at L4-5 and moderate at L3-4.  There is significant facet arthropathy at 
L3-4 and L4-5.  There appears to be facet incompetence at L34.  There is a grade 1 
spondylolisthesis at L4-5.
Mr. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication and 
their corresponding findings on MRI.  At this point in time given the worsening of leg 
dominance symptoms and back pain, limited walking and standing tolerance and the 
overall impact on his quality of life, I am referring him for spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. Smith.  Flexion-extension radiographs were performed today as a presurgical measure.  
Mr. Smith should continue with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.

the left.  The symptoms began about a year ago and are worsening.  There is an increase in 
pain with walking and standing and he reports that his walking tolerance is limited to about 
100 yards before he has to sit.  Symptoms are relieved after few minutes of sitting and he 
can continue.  He does not report any change to his bowel or bladder functioning and there 
is no saddle anesthesia or any perineal numbness.  He reports that he is able to get 
restorative sleep.  He continues to attend for chiropractic care on a monthly basis but 
without any significant relief.
Medication includes tramadol 3 to 4 tablets/day.  Other medications include Crestor and 
meloxicam.
Review of his general health reveals that his health is otherwise good.  He does have a 
dyslipidemia.  He has osteoarthritis of the right knee.  He does not have any known allergies 
and he does not smoke.  Prior surgeries include to the left index finger and a vasectomy.  
He is able to manage his chores at home.

An MRI of the lumbar spine was performed at GMI on May 16, 2022.  This reveals a left L5-
S1 disc protrusion and significant left lateral recess stenosis.
Mr. Smith is continuing to have left S1 radicular symptoms although there is no 
significant motor deficit on examination today.  The symptoms are continuing to 
significantly impact on his quality of life.  As such, and in consideration of the MRI findings, 
I am referring him for surgical opinion with Dr.Smith, neurosurgeon.  He should continue 
with self-directed exercises and activity to tolerance.  He can continue with the chiropractic 
care if he finds benefit.

365,365,834,2022-11-08 00:00:00,Yes,No,No,0,1,364,6,0.0,1.0,0.0,"Heidi  is a 64 y/o female, presenting with left L5 radicular pain with right sided buttock and groin pain. Her MRI is consistent with severe L3-4 canal stenosis and left L4-5 foraminal stenosis. The patient's clincal exam and history are not entirely consistent with typical neurogenic claudication, however, we cannot entirely exclude a contribution from this to her current symptoms. 
 
Our differential for her current presentation includes a left L5 radiculopathy with a possible component of sacroiliitus or right sided hip osteoarthritis, given the deep right groin pain. In order to further characterize this, we will be ordering same day X-rays of the spine and hip --> upon review, these do reveal moderate arthrosis of the right hip.
 
Given the uncertainty of the etiology of her symptoms. We recommend a referral to a pain clinic for diagnostic and therapeutic considerations, and she would like to pursue an option closer to home, therefore I will leave this in the hands of her family physician. Given the XR findings today I would recommend image-guided injections targeting the right SI joint and subsequently intraarticular into the right hip, to help provide further diagnostic clarity. Should these not provide her with adequate or durable relief, she knows to contact my office to revisit the idea of lumbar decompression. ",,"Ms. Smith presents with a history of leg pain, left more than right, which began about a 
year and a half ago.  There was worsening pain to the feet and an increase in pain with 
walking.  More recently she has experienced marked improvement with medication 
including Toradol and pregabalin but dosages are not known.  She is performing exercises 
and yoga which helps a little.  She has not had any formal physical therapies.  She does not 
report any urinary retention and there is no perineal numbness.  She is able to manage 
chores at home.
A review of her medical history reveals that she was in a recent motor vehicle accident 
which exacerbated back pain.  She has a history of hypertension and hypothyroidism.  More 
recently she has has swollen lymph nodes at her mandibular angle and this is being further 
investigated.  She has seasonal allergies.  She smokes about a pack of cigarettes per day.
Medications include an antihypertensive and thyroid medication as well as a PPI, but she 
could not recall the names.  She also takes hydrochlorothiazide.
Ms. Smith is Smith.  Her gait and cadence is normal and she was not using any 
supports.  She could not perform heel walking.  There was an increase in pain with lumbar 
spine extension.  Toe walking could be performed without difficulty.  Muscle stretch reflexes 
are 1+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1 except for the left 
EHL which is mildly weak at 4+/5.  There is diminished sensation along the left L5 
dermatome.  Straight leg raising is not provocative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are 
within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is negative Hoffmann sign 
bilaterally.  There are no long tract signs.
A lumbar MRI was performed March 5, 2022 at GMI.  There is a severe canal stenosis at L3-
4 and moderate at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  There is moderate to 
severe left foraminal stenosis at L4-5.
My clinical impression is Ms. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication related to the 
spinal stenosis.  She is concerned about being on medications and the effect on her liver 
longer-term.  She did try to titrate down on the pain relieving medications but her 
symptoms increased.  Therefore I am referring her on for a spine surgical consultation with 
Dr. D. Guha.  Pending this consultation she may wish to trial some physical therapy and she 
should be continuing with self-directed flexion-based exercises.  I have recommended that 
she follow-up with the advanced practice professional in the community for exercise review.

That is actually surprising given her complaints.  Imaging shows an oligotrophic spine looking osteopenic with a low-grade degenerative scoliosis in the AP plane and diffuse discopathy.  MRI shows a surprisingly high-grade mixed central and neuroforaminal stenosis L4-5 largely originating and ligamentum flavum hypertrophy with a similar but less aggressive stenosis at L3-4 as well.
 
The benign physical exam presentation here at rest is surgically discouraging but that is a trap and spinal stenosis, what is important of the functional complaints.  If pain were her only issue I had encourage her to be off to the pain clinic looking at epidurals but she is weak enough to be following already in not getting up and down the stairs properly so it is time to get her decompressed and help give her her strength back.
 
With her husband attending of explained the pathoanatomy of her problem on what would be involved in corrective surgery with attention to risk/benefit and convalescent timeframe issues, she needed a decompression and instrumented stabilization L3 5.

I will look forward to helping her out down the line as I can but I have cautioned her that I expect its not can to be for at least a year or 2 until I can get to her.",,"Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left buttock and leg pain and bilateral foot 
numbness and heaviness with walking.  There is increased symptoms with walking and 
standing and relieved with lying down.  She is able to get restful sleep for the most part.  
She does not report any change to her bowel or bladder functioning and there is no 
perineal numbness or any saddle anesthesia.  She has attended for physical therapy and 
acupuncture on a weekly basis but is not certain if it is helping.  She does attended a gym 
facility.
Medications include gabapentin 100 mg 3 times daily and Toradol as needed.  Other 
medications include EstroGel, progesterone, zopiclone, and Smith for lupus.
Review of her medical history reveals a history of lupus.  She is allergic to sulfa and has 
seasonal allergies.  She does not smoke.  Her surgical history includes C-section and surgery 
for a parathyroid tumor as well as melanoma on her face.  She reports difficulty with 
completing chores at home due to her limited functioning in walking and standing.
Physical examination reveals that her gait and cadence is normal and she was not using any 
supports.  She stands 5 feet with 115 pounds.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar 
spine extension.  She could heel and toe walk without difficulty.  Reflexes are 2+ at the 
patella and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1.  Muscle tone and bulk is 
symmetrical and sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is not 
provocative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  Upper limb reflexes 
are 2+ with negative Hoffmann sign bilaterally.
A lumbar MRI was performed at GMI on June 18, 2022.  This reveals severe spinal canal 
stenosis at L4-5 and mild at L5-S1.  There is left-sided L4-5 foraminal stenosis. There is a 
grade 1 spondylolisthesis at L4-5.
Ms. Smith presents with symptoms commensurate with neurogenic claudication.  She is 
severely stenotic at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative changes.  Given this and the 
lack of significant improvement in functioning despite conservative measures and the 
passage of time, I am referring her for a spine surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  
Standing plain film radiographs of the lumbar spine were performed today in preparation 
for the surgical consult.  I have encouraged Ms. Smith to continue with self-directed 
flexion-based exercises.  She could continue with physical therapy should she find benefit.

I just hope I can do it safely.
 
With her husband attending I have explained the problem and offered the potential benefit to be had from appropriate reconstruction here.  She is amenable and gave me consent accordingly but was almost tearfully distraught when I had to remind her of the wait list which likely CMP 6 months or year until I can get to her.
 
Her oxycodone that works well for her so I am inclined to encourage her to use the stuff.  She is very worried about being addicted and I do not think that is a risk when the patient is using the medication sparingly and getting good pain relief with it, but habituation is a different thing that we cannot deny.
 
Just in recent months she is actually moved to North Bay to be close to family where she is helping with the care of grandkids and she does not have a new family doctor up there, so accessing her prescription of course will be a challenge.  Today I have advised her that she should feel free to use the oxycodone set at least twice daily to try to get some element of pain control, she tells me she is got enough tablets to last the month so I wrote her up prescription for 360 tablets that should be 6 months worth, these to be dispensed in 120 tablet aliquots that should last 2 months each with the first dispensing to be done not before December 1 this year.  By the time all that runs out we should be getting somewhere close to the OR time.",," Ms. Smith presents with a complaint of left leg painful paresthesia which began about 9 
months ago and which is not improving.  She has significant functional limitations with 
walking and standing of less than 5 minutes.  The pain starts in the left buttock travels to 
the foot.  She has had physical therapy without relief.  She does not report any change to 
her bowel or bladder functioning and there is no perineal numbness.  She has not had any 
injections.
Medications include naproxen and oxycodone.  Other medications include ramipril, 
clopidogrel, Smith, pantoprazole, prednisone, diclofenac, nitroglycerin, metoprolol and 
amlodipine.
The medical history reveals that she suffered a myocardial infarction last month but did not 
require any stenting.  She has a history of osteoarthritis and asthma.  She had lumbar spine 
fusion surgery in 2008 with Dr. Smith.  She has paresthesia through the left hand.  She has 
allergies including environmental allergies and to mold.  She does not smoke.  Her surgical 
history includes otherwise hysterectomy and tonsillectomy.  She has significant difficulty 
with her activities of daily living and has been using a walker.
On physical examination her habitus is endomorphic.  She was using a walker to help her 
ambulate.  There is an anterior list of her torso.  There is an increase in pain with lumbar 
spine extension.  Reflexes are 2+ at the patella and Achilles.  Power is graded 5/5 except for 
the left EHL which is 3+/5 and to resisted left foot dorsiflexion is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and 
bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is diminished along the left L5 dermatome.  Slump and 
straight leg raising is positive on the left.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal limits.  
Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  Hoffman sign is negative bilaterally.
A CT of the lumbar spine was performed June 6, 2022 and reveals severe foraminal stenosis 
at L5-S1.  Extensive lumbar hardware is noted.  On personal review there is appear apparent 
failure of lumbosacral hardware.  There is extensive vacuum phenomenon of the L5-S1 disc. 
 The spinal canal could not be adequately visualized due to hardware artifact, but it is 
apparent that there is fairly significant foraminal stenosis, more so on the left.
My clinical impression is that Ms. Smith is experiencing left L5 radiculopathy.  Fortunately 
today Dr. Smith was in the clinic and he graciously agreed to see Ms. Smith.  Plain film 
radiographs were performed which reveals hardware failure and L5-S1 disc collapse.  Dr. 
Smith has scheduled her for remedial surgery but this may take some time.  Further 
comment is deferred to Dr. Smith's report.  Ms. Smith did ask me about medication 
options and I defer to her physician but I query whether a neuromodulator such as 
gabapentin may be helpful.  She did say that she did not have any success with Lyrica.  I 
have recommended that she continue with activity to tolerance.

I have not booked her for routine follow-up at this time.",,"Ms. Smith presents with right leg pain which began in August 2022.  The pain is 
through the anterior leg to the ankle and there is also pain through the right groin.  She 
had physical therapy which was not helpful.  She denies any change to her bowel or bladder 
functioning and there is no perineal numbness.  She is not doing much in the way of any 
exercises currently.  Most of her pain is through the right groin and buttock.  She is taking a 
neuromodulator, the name of which she could not recall.
Review of her medical history reveals diabetes and hypertension.  She had a total left knee 
replacement and revision in 2021.  She has osteoarthritis of the shoulders and hips and has 
had cortisone injections to her shoulders and left hip.  She is allergic to codeine.  She does 
not smoke.  Her surgical history includes mastectomy for breast cancer, hysterectomy, as 
well as the left total knee replacement.  Medications include metformin, insulin and an 
antihypertensive the name of which she could not recall.  Ms. Smith is very limited with 
respect to her abilities to perform activities of daily living.
On physical examination her habitus is endomorphic.  She was in a wheelchair and says that 
she cannot walk for very long.  There was an increase in pain with attempted flexion and 
extension of the lumbar spine.  She could not perform heel and toe walking.  Muscle stretch 
reflexes are 1+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally. Power is graded 5/5 except for the 
right quadricep which is 4+/5.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical and sensation is 
preserved in all dermatomes.  Straight leg raising is positive on the right with nerve root 
tension.  There is some diminished internal rotation of the right hip with an increase in pain. 
 Upper limb reflexes are 2+ with negative Hoffmann sign.
A lumbar MRI was performed at GMI on October 21, 2022 and this reveals a right-sided L4-
5 foraminal stenosis.
My clinical impression is Ms. Smith has symptoms commensurate with right L4 nerve 
root irritation and she also may have some right hip internal derangement or arthralgia.  
Plain film radiographs of the hip were performed today but these revealed only mild 
osteoarthritis.  It remains my opinion that there may be internal derangement and possibly 
a labral tear.  She appears to have some right L4 radicular symptoms but there is no 
significant motor deficit other than some mild weakness of the right quadricep.  At this 
point in time she may be a candidate for surgical consultation should she not respond to an 
epidural injection.  I referred her to a pain clinic for consideration of a right L4-5 
transforaminal epidural injection.  I recommend that she be referred into the hip and knee 
hip and knee central intake program for further evaluation.  Should she  respond to the 
injection then surgical consultation will be considered with Dr. Smith.

L3-4 level being worse.  Patient's clinical history and examination are consistent with the MRI findings.  Patient like to go down surgical pathway.  We discussed doing L3-L5 posterior decompression plus or minus instrumentation and fusion depending what the dynamic x-rays show.  Possible complications being dural tear with CSF leak, postoperative hematoma, wound infection, blood loss, blood transfusion, injury to nerve roots.  This is not an exhaustive list
 
We will try to get his surgery done sooner than later.
 
He needs to be off his warfarin at least 5 to 7 days.  We will contact thrombosis.",,"Review of his medical history reveals that he suffers from factor Smith and dyslipidemia.  
He has had blood clots in both the right and the left legs.  He does not smoke.  He is 
allergic to penicillin and pollen.  Prior surgeries include a left knee arthroscopic procedure 
and hernia.  Medications include warfarin and a statin.  Mr. Smith is limited with his 
ability to perform his activities of daily living.
On physical examination he was greeted in the reception area.  His gait and cadence was 
normal and he was not using any supports.  He stands 5 feet 7 inches weight 185 pounds.  
There was an increase in pain with lumbar spine extension.  There was Smith sign with 
lumbar spine extension from of flexed position.  He could heel and toe walk without 
difficulty.  Reflexes are 2+ at the patella and Achilles bilaterally.  Power is graded 5/5 L2-S1 
bilaterally.  Muscle tone and bulk is symmetrical.  Sensation is preserved in all dermatomes.  
Straight leg raising is not provocative bilaterally.  Hip ranges of motion are within normal 
limits.  Upper limb reflexes are 2+.  There is negative Hoffmann sign bilaterally.  There is no 
clonus or any spasticity.
A lumbar MRI was performed July 4, 2022 at GMI.  There is severe spinal canal stenosis at 
L3-4 and moderate to severe canal stenosis at L4-5 from a combination of degenerative 
changes.  At L3-4 on the right there is a disc protrusion with caudal migration and 
impingement of the right L4 nerve root.  There is advanced facet arthropathy at L4-5.
My clinical impression is that Mr. Smith is experiencing neurogenic claudication along 
with mechanical back pain.  Given the ongoing and worsening of his symptoms I am 
referring him for surgical consultation with Dr. Smith.  At the same time for his lower 
back pain I have referred him to a pain clinic for consideration of medial branch/facet joint 
blocks.  I have encouraged him to continue with self-directed flexion-based exercises and 
activity to tolerance.
Thank you for involving me in the care of this patient
